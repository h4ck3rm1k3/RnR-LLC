Known Problems & Limitations
============================

 * The new Eclipse-based user interface is in Beta status. Functionalities and
   documentation may be incorrect or missing.


 * General

     - Simics doesn't honor control-C when running with all processors disabled
       (bug #4285).

     - Running the 'x' command towards device space may cause assertions.
       Many devices assume certain alignment and width on the accesses (bug
       #1428).

     - Complex memory mappings involving at least two byte-swapping operations
       with different sizes may be incorrectly handled (bug #4060).

 * Breakpoints

     - Virtual-address execution breakpoints may not work reliably if the
       physical memory area where the code resides is mapped at several virtual
       addresses. If the instructions are first executed from a virtual address
       where no breakpoint is set, the breakpoint may not be triggered later on
       when executing from the virtual address on which the breakpoint was
       set. (bug #1074).

     - Time breakpoints can not be removed. (bug #106).

     - ID numbers of deleted breakpoints may be re-used for new breakpoints.
       This may cause confusion if a hap handler for the deleted breakpoint is
       still active. (bug #2490)

 * Device Compatibility

     - The SYM53C875 device model doesn't work with the Windows XP device
       driver. The SYM53C810 device does work, and can be used instead (bug
       #49).

 * Device Limitations

     - The SCSI disk model does not support tagged queues (bug #3175).

 * Distributed Simulation

     - When a checkpoint is taken of several processes participating in a
       distributed simulation, reloading those checkpoints will not always
       restore the synchronization of the clocks in the processes. This means
       that starting from the checkpoints may not reproduce the simulation that
       would have happened if the simulation had continued without taking the
       checkpoint. Running the simulation from the checkpoints is still
       deterministic in the sense that it can be reproduced by restarting from
       the same checkpoints. (bug #686).

     - It is not possible to use Hindsight to reverse a distributed simulation.
       (bug #5302)       

 * Ethernet Link

     - Speed auto-negotiation on an ethernet-link is not implemented (bug
       #1083).

     - DHCP leases with a limited lifetime are not recycled by the DHCP server
       in the service-node. This means that the the server may run out of
       available leases in cases when it shouldn't. (bug #2017).

     - When a network device changes its MAC address, it may for a short time
       still receive and accept packets for the old MAC address. (bug #2164).

     - Changing the processor frequency during simulation is not
       recommended. In particular, it would break packet delivery timing during
       network simulation (bug #4738).

 * Hindsight:

     - Script branches are not completely Hindsight compatible (the state of
       the script is not reversed). (Bug #3812)

     - All targets have not been Hindsight-certified. In particular, some x86
       models are not fully Hindsight compatible and leak memory when executing
       backwards. (bug #1874).
       
     - When running backward with a hindsight-aware gdb, watchpoints are not
       handled properly (bug #4065).

     - The trace module is not compatible with Hindsight and will output
       garbage if tracing is enabled while running backward (bug #4180).

 * Host-related Problems

     - Weird output in the console window when running Simics on a remote
       desktop (Windows XP). This problem can be worked around by adding the
       line:
         set SDL_VIDEODRIVER=windib
       to the script that starts Simics.

     - On Windows, running Simics in a Cygwin xterm (or rxvt) console is not
       supported.  If Simics is run in this way, pressing control-c will return
       control to the shell, leaving the Simics process unaccessable in the
       background. Simics can be run from a "standard" Windows command prompt
       (either in a Cygwin/bash shell, or using cmd.exe), however
       tab-completion does not work (bug #3714).

     - On Windows, when running targets with a SDL console (such as Enterprise
       or Dredd), control-C cannot be used to break simulation. Use Ctrl+Break
       instead (bug #4463).

     - On Windows, it is not possible to make Simics echo commands executed
       when starting a session from a .simics script by specifying the "-echo"
       flag in the "Command line flags" field of the Preferences dialog
       (bug #5092).
       As a workaround, the "-echo" flag can be specified when starting Simics
       from a command shell (e.g. cmd.exe or cygwin bash). The following
       example will launch the First Steps machine and echo all executed Simics
       commands:
       C:\>[simics]\x86-win32\bin\simics-wx\simics.exe
           -echo targets\ebony\ebony-linux-firststeps.simics

 * Installation

     - If Simics is installed read-only, Python files in Simics (scripts and
       commands) can not be compiled, which will affect start-up
       performance. If you are starting Simics very often (for example, for
       many small tests), you may want to run Simics directly from the tree
       (read-write) once to let Python compile the files you need (bug #3570).

 * Micro-Architecture Interface
        
     - Not all scripts available in Simics 2.x have been converted to the new
       targets scripts; for example, the P4 memory hierarchy is missing (bug
       #4392).

 * Real Network

     - Setting the tx_bandwidth and tx_packet_rate attributes of a real network
       connection to very high or unlimited values may cause an event queue
       overflow. If this happens, use lower values. (bug #2930).

     - Connecting the same link to the real network twice can cause
       problems. (bug #2148).

 * Serial Link

     - Setting the bandwidth throttle too high in a <serial-link> object may
       cause the event queue to overflow. (bug #2028).

 * SimicsFS
 
     - if a directory is accessed through simicsfs, and the directory is
       actually a symbolic link with a trailing slash, it might not be
       accessible. (bug #2186).

 * Source Code Debugging:

     - Source stepping functions (step into, step over, and so on) and
       run-to-line may leave breakpoints behind if the simulation is stopped
       by something unrelated. (Bug #3115).

     - Source stepping functions do not always work well in the
       absence of a running process tracker, since they will then be
       unable to tell the difference between their own process and the
       rest of the system. (Bug 4784.)

 * x86 Target:
 
     - Starting X does not work on some hippie configurations. (bug #2631).

     - Some newer Fedora/Redhat distributions and derivates use a graphical
       boot-progress screen that does not work with the Voodoo3 device in
       Simics. (Error message "unknown packet type 7"). The workaround is to
       remove "rhgb" from the boot command line in the boot menu. (bug #2243).
