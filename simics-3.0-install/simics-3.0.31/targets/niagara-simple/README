The niagara-simple machine needs an Openboot PROM and a Solaris dump to boot.
These files can be found on the opensparc.org web page, bundled with the
UltraSPARC T1 simulator from Sun.

Copy the files in the S10image/ directory of the Sun simulator package to
[simics]/targets/niagara-simple/images/. The files needed are:

1up-hv.bin
1up-md.bin
1g2p-hv.bin
1g2p-md.bin
1g32p-hv.bin
1g32p-md.bin
disk.s10hw2
openboot.bin
q.bin
reset.bin

The possible machine configurations are currently limited by the files 
supplied by Sun. The memory size is set at 256MB, and the processor frequency 
is 5MHz.There are three processor configurations:

* 1 core,  1 strand/core
* 2 cores, 1 strand/core
* 8 cores, 4 strands/core

The default configuration includes a disk diff file that adds the "simicsfs"
file-system to the disk.s10hw2 image. If using a different disk image, set the
CLI variable $use_simicsfs to "no" before starting.
