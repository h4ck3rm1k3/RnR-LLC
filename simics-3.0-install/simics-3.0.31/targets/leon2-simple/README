For more details on the leon2-simple machine, see the leon2-simple
target guide. 

The scripts provided here allows you to start some Virtutech-provided
sample binaries with the option of skipping the memory zeroing when
RTEMS boots, as discussed in the leon2-simple target guide.  To load a
particular program, create a small script in your
WORKSPACE/targets/leon2-simple/ directory, containing something like
the following:

#----
$binary_to_load = "rtems-tasks.elf"
$skip_memory_zero = 1
run-command-file "%script%/leon2-simple-rtems.simics"
#----


The programs provided by Virtutech are:

rtems-hello2.elf

  Simple hello world program, prints:

  *** HELLO WORLD TEST ***
  Hello World
  *** END OF HELLO WORLD TEST ***

rtems-paranois.elf

  Tests the IEEE floating point conformance. Lots of printouts.

rtems-dhrystone.elf

  Dhrystone benchmark on RTEMS, you have to enter the number of
  iterations in the console.

rtems-tasks.elf

  Tests the clock (uses the sleep mode).
