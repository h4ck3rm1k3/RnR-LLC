The frolic machine is an example of running a binary on a machine without any
operating system. In this example setup, a 'gzip' binary is loaded and it
compresses 'TESTFILE'. Both these files have to be provided by the user, and
placed in the home/frolic/ directory. The 'gzip' file should be a statically
linked SPARC binary, and 'TESTFILE' can be any file.

By modifying frolic.simics, some other program can be run. That program should
be a statically linked binary. If it uses any syscalls, they have to be
implemented in frolic.py, with the "fake OS".

There are some very simple implementations of syscalls already included:

  brk()
  chmod()
  chown()
  close()
  exit()
  fstat()
  ioctl()
  llseek()
  lstat()
  open()
  read()
  sigaction()
  stat()
  unlink()
  utime()
  write()
  open64()
  stat64()
  fstat64()
  getuid()
  getpid()
