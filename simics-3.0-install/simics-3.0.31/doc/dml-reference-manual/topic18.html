<p>
For the most part, the lexical structure of DML resembles that of C.
However, DML distinguishes between "object context" and "C context", so
that some C keywords such as <tt>register</tt>, <tt>signed</tt> and
<tt>unsigned</tt>, are allowed as identifiers in object context, while
on the other hand many words that look like keywords in the object
context, such as <tt>bank</tt>, <tt>event</tt> and <tt>data</tt>, are in
fact allowed as identifiers in all contexts.
<p>
Another major difference from C is that names do not generally need to
be defined before their first use. This is quite useful, but might
sometimes appear confusing to C programmers.
<p>
<dl><dt><b>Reserved words</b></dt><dd>All ISO/ANSI C reserved words are reserved words in DML (even if
currently unused). In addition, the C99 and C++ reserved words
<tt>restrict</tt>, <tt>inline</tt>, <tt>this</tt>, <tt>new</tt>,
<tt>delete</tt>, <tt>throw</tt>, <tt>try</tt>, <tt>catch</tt>, and
<tt>template</tt> are also reserved in DML. The C++ reserved words
<tt>class</tt>, <tt>namespace</tt>, <tt>private</tt>,
<tt>protected</tt>, <tt>public</tt>, <tt>using</tt>, and
<tt>virtual</tt>, are reserved in DML for future use.
<p>
The following words are reserved specially by DML: <tt>after</tt>,
<tt>assert</tt>, <tt>call</tt>, <tt>cast</tt>, <tt>defined</tt>,
<tt>error</tt>, <tt>foreach</tt>, <tt>in</tt>, <tt>is</tt>,
<tt>local</tt>, <tt>log</tt>, <tt>parameter</tt>, <tt>select</tt>,
<tt>sizeoftype</tt>, <tt>typeof</tt>, <tt>undefined</tt>, <tt>vect</tt>,
and <tt>where</tt>.
<p>
</dd><dt><b>Identifiers</b></dt><dd>Identifiers in DML are defined as in C; an identifier may begin with
a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or
underscores. Within C context, object-context identifiers are always
prefixed by a <tt>$</tt> character. </dd><dt><b>Constant Literals</b></dt><dd>DML does not support octal constants (written with a leading
<tt>0</tt> in C); however, DML adds binary constants, written
"<tt>0b...</tt>", as in <tt>0b1111</tt> or <tt>0b11000011</tt>.</dd><dt><b>Comments</b></dt><dd>Both ordinary C-style (<tt>/</tt><tt>*</tt>...<tt>*</tt><tt>/</tt>)
comments and C++/C99 (<tt>//</tt>...) comments are allowed in DML.</dd></dl>
