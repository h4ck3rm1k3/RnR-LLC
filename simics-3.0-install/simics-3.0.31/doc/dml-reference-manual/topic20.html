<h3 class="jdocu">4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source File Structure</h3 class="jdocu">


<a name="label108"></a>
<p>
A DML source file describes both the structure of the modeled device and
the actions to be taken when the device is accessed.
<p>
A DML source file defining a device starts with a <em>language version
declaration</em> and a <em>device declaration</em>. After that, any
number of <em>parameter declarations</em>, <em>methods</em>, <em>data
fields</em>, <em>object declarations</em>, or <em>global
declarations</em> can be written. A DML file intended to be
<em>imported</em> (by an <tt>import</tt> statement in another DML file)
has the same layout except for the device declaration.
<p>
<a name="label109"></a><h4 class="jdocu">4.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language Version Declaration</h4 class="jdocu">


<a name="label110"></a>
<p>
Every DML source file should contain a version declaration, on the form
"<tt>dml </tt><i>m</i><tt>.</tt><i>n</i><tt>;</tt>", where <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are
nonnegative integers denoting the major and minor version of DML,
respectively, that the source file is written in. The version
declaration allows the <tt>dmlc</tt> compiler to select the proper
versions of the DML parser and standard libraries to be used for the
file. (Note that each file has its own individual language version, even
if it is imported by a file using another version.) A file should not
import a file with a higher language version than its own.
<p>
The version declaration must be the first declaration in the file,
possibly preceded by comments. For example:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    // My Device
    dml 1.0;
    ...
</pre>
<p>
A file that does not contain any version declaration is assumed to have
the version DML 0.9, for reasons of backward compatibility with existing
legacy code, but this feature will eventually be deprecated. All new
code should use DML 1.0 or later, and all old code should at a minimum
be given the version declaration "dml 0.9;", or preferably be rewritten
in DML 1.0.
<p>

<a name="label111"></a><h4 class="jdocu">4.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Device Declaration</h4 class="jdocu">


<a name="label112"></a>
<p>
Every DML source file that contains a device declaration is a <em>DML
program</em>, and defines a device class with the specified name. Such a
file may <em>import</em> other files, but only the initial file may
contain a device declaration.
<p>
The device declaration must be the first proper declaration in the file,
only preceded by comments and the language version declaration. For
example:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    /*
     *  My New Device
     */
    dml 1.0;
    device my_device;
    ...
</pre>

The following is an example of a small DML program defining a very
simple device. This lacks many details that would appear in a real
device.

<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    dml 1.0;

    device excalibur;

    connect bus {
      interface pci;
    }

    bank config_registers {
        parameter function = 0;
        register cfg1 size 4 @ 0x0000 {
            field status {
                method read { ... }
                method write { ... }
            }
            field enable {
              method read { ... }
              method write { ... }
            }
        }
    }

    bank databank {
        parameter function = 1;
        register r1 size 4 @ 0x0000 {
            field f1 {
                method read { ... }
                method write { ... }
            }
        }
        register r2 size 4 @ 0x0004 {
            field f2 {
                method read { ... }
                method write { ... }
            }
        }
    }
