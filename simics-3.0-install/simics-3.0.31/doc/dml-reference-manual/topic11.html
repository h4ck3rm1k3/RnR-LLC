<h3 class="jdocu">3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registers</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
A <em><a name="label82">register</a></em> is an component of a register bank that
contains an integer value, which can be either unsigned (the default) or
signed. Normally, a register corresponds to a segment of consecutive
locations in the address space of the bank; however, it is also possible
(and often useful) to have registers that are not mapped to any address
within the bank.
<p>
Every register has a fixed <em>size</em> (or <em>width</em>), which is
an integral, nonzero number of 8-bit bytes. A single register cannot be
wider than 8 bytes, in DML 1.0. The size of the register is given by the
<tt>size<a name="label83"></a></tt> parameter,
which can be specified either by a normal parameter assignment, as in
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    register r1 {
      parameter size = 4;
      ...
    }
</pre>
or more commonly, using the following short-hand syntax:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    register r1 size 4 {
      ...
    }
</pre>
which has the same meaning. The default size is provided by the
<tt>register_size<a name="label84"></a></tt>
parameter of the containing register bank, if that is defined.
<p>
The value of the register can be accessed directly by referencing the
object, as in
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    log "info": "the value of register r1 is %d", $r1;
</pre>
or
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    $r1 += 1;
</pre>
<p>
Storage for the register value is created by default in the generated C
code. If this is not needed (e.g., if write accesses to the register are
ignored and read accesses always return a constant value such as 0), it
can be disabled in order to save memory by setting the
<tt>allocate<a name="label85"></a></tt>
parameter to <tt>false</tt>. Non-allocated registers cannot be accessed
by value.
<p>
<a name="label86"></a><h4 class="jdocu">3.7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mapping Addresses To Registers </h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
For a register to be mapped into the internal address space of the
containing bank, its starting address within the bank must be given by
setting the
<tt>offset<a name="label87"></a></tt>
parameter. The address range occupied by the register is then from
<tt>offset</tt> to <tt>offset</tt> + <tt>size</tt> - 1. The offset
can be specified by a normal parameter assignment, as in
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    register r1 {
      parameter offset = 0x0100;
      ...
    }
</pre>
or using the following short-hand syntax:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    register r1 @ 0x0100 {
      ...
    }
</pre>
similar to the <tt>size</tt> parameter above. Usually, a normal
read/write register does not need any additional specifications apart
from the size and offset, and can simply be written like this:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    register r1 size 4 @ 0x0100;
</pre>
or, if the bank contains several registers of the same size:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    bank b1 {
      parameter register_size = 4;
      register r1 @ 0x0100;
      register r2 @ 0x0103;
      ...
    }
</pre>
<p>
The translation from the bank address space to the actual value of the
register is controlled by the <tt>byte_order<a name="label88"></a></tt> parameter. When it is set to
<tt>"little-endian"</tt> (the default), the lowest address, i.e., that
defined by <tt>offset</tt>, corresponds to the least significant byte in
the register, and when set to <tt>"big-endian"</tt>, the lowest address
corresponds to the most significant byte in the register.  The third
allowed value of this parameter is <tt>undefined</tt>, which ensures
that neither assumption is ever made.
<p>

<a name="label89"></a><h4 class="jdocu">3.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Register Attributes</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
For every register, an attribute of integer type is automatically added
to the Simics configuration class generated from the device model. The
name of the attribute corresponds to the hierarchy in the DML model;
e.g., a register named <tt>r1</tt> in a bank named <tt>bank0</tt> will
get a corresponding attribute named <i>bank0_r1</i>.
<p>
The register value is automatically saved when Simics creates a
<a name="label90">checkpoint</a>, unless the
<tt>configuration<a name="label91"></a></tt>
parameter indicates otherwise.
<p>

<a name="label92"></a><h4 class="jdocu">3.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fields</h4 class="jdocu">


<a name="label93"></a>
<p>
Real hardware registers often have a number of <em>fields</em> with
separate meaning. For example, the lowest three bits of the register
could be a status code, the next six bits could be a set of flags, and
the rest of the bits could be reserved.
<p>
To make this easy to express, a <b>register</b> object can
contain a number of <b>field</b> objects. Each field is defined
to correspond to a bit range of the containing register. (Technically, a
register that does not contain any explicitly defined fields
automatically gets a single, anonymous field, which covers the whole
register.)
<p>
Only the values of the fields are stored in the generated C code; the
value of the register as a whole is composed from the field values when
needed (for example, when creating a Simics checkpoint). Storage for
individual fields can be controlled by the
<tt>allocate<a name="label94"></a></tt>
parameter, which by default is inherited from the
<b>register</b> object.
<p>
For example, the register described above could be modeled as follows,
using the default little-endian bit numbering.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    bank b2 {
      register r0 size 4 @ 0x0000 {
        field status   [2:0];
        field flags    [8:3];
        field reserved [15:9] {
          parameter allocate = false;
        } ;
      }
      ...
    }
</pre>
<p>
Note that the most significant bit number is always the first number (to
the left of the colon) in the range, regardless of whether little-endian
or big-endian bit numbering is used. (The bit numbering convention used
in a source file can be selected by a <tt><a name="label95">bitorder</a></tt>
declaration.)
<p>
The value of the field can be accessed by referencing the
object, as for a register, e.g.:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    log "info": "the value of the status field is %d", $r0.status;
</pre>
Note however that non-allocated fields cannot be accessed this way,
since they do not have a stored value.
