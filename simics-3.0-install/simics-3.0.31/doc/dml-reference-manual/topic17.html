<p>
DML is not a general-purpose programming language, but a modeling
language, targeted at writing Simics device models. The algorithmic part
of the language is an extended subset of ISO C; however, the main power
of DML is derived from its simple object-oriented constructs for
defining and accessing the static data structures that a device model
requires, and the automatic creation of bindings to Simics.
<p>
Furthermore, DML provides syntax for <em>bit-slicing</em>, which much
simplifies the manipulation of bit fields in integers; <tt>new</tt> and
<tt>delete</tt> operators for allocating and deallocating memory; a
basic <tt>try</tt>/<tt>throw</tt> mechanism for error handling; built-in
<tt>log</tt> and <tt>assert</tt> statements; and a powerful
metaprogramming facility using <em>templates</em>, method inlining, and
compile-time evaluation for shaping the generated code.
<p>
Most of the built-in Simics-specific logic is implemented directly in
DML, in standard library modules that are automatically imported; the
<tt>dmlc</tt> compiler itself contains as little knowledge as possible
about the specifics of Simics.
