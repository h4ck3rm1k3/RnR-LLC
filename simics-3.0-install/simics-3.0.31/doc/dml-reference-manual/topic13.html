<h3 class="jdocu">3.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connects</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
A <em>connect</em> object is a container for a reference to an arbitrary
Simics configuration object. An attribute with the same name as the
connect, that can be assigned a value of type "Simics object", is added
to the Simics configuration class generated from the device model. A
connect is thus similar to a simple <b>attribute</b> object.
<p>
Typically, the connected object is expected to implement one or more
particular Simics-interfaces, such as <tt>simple_interrupt</tt> (see the
<em>Simics Reference Manual</em> for details).
<p>
Initialization of the connect (i.e., setting the object reference) is
typically done from outside the device, usually in a Simics
configuration file. As for attributes, the parameter
<tt>configuration</tt> controls whether the value must be initialized
when the object is created, and whether it is automatically saved when a
checkpoint is created; see Section <a class="jdocu" href="topic30.html#label383">5.1.8</a>.

<p>
In order to use the Simics interfaces that a connected object
implements, they must be declared within the <b>connect</b>.
This is done through <em>interface</em> objects, which name the expected
interfaces and may also specify additional properties.
<p>
An important property of an interface object is whether or not a
connected object is <em>required</em> to implement the interface. This
can be controlled through the interface parameter <tt>required</tt>,
which is <tt>true</tt> by default; see Section <a class="jdocu" href="topic30.html#label391">5.1.9</a>. Attempting to connect an object that does not fulfill the
requirement will cause a runtime error.
<p>
By default, the C type of the Simics interface corresponding to a
particular interface object is assumed to be the name of the object
itself with the string <tt>"_interface_t"</tt> appended. (The C type is
typically a <tt>typedef</tt>:ed name for a struct containing function
pointers). This can be changed by specifying an explicit <tt>c_type</tt>
parameter in the interface object.
<p>
The following is an example of a connect with two interfaces, one of
which is not required:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    connect plugin {
      interface serial_device;
      interface rs232_device { parameter required = false; }
    }
</pre>
