<p>
  Solaris can be installed directly on the simulated machine in Simics.
  Solaris can be obtained from Sun's web-site at
  <a class="jdocu" href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/binaries/get.html" target="_top">http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/binaries/get.html</a> in the
  form of ISO images.
<p>
  To simplify the installation process, some scripts are supplied with the
  Simics distribution for the peanut machine:
  <tt>peanut-sol&lt;version&gt;-cd-install1.simics</tt>,  
  <tt>peanut-sol&lt;version&gt;-cd-install2.simics</tt> and
  <tt>peanut-sol&lt;version&gt;-cd-install3.simics</tt>,
  where &lt;version&gt; is <tt>8</tt>, <tt>9</tt> or <tt>10</tt>.  The scripts
  will answer all questions automatically to create a standard workstation
  install.
<p>
  It is also possible to install Solaris 2.6 and Solaris 7 on Simics, but for
  that, no automatic scripts are supplied.
<p>
  <a name="label448"></a><h4 class="jdocu">6.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation, step by step</h4 class="jdocu">

  
  This section describes how to install Solaris using the command-line
  version Simics.
  <ol>
<p>
  <li>
  Select the install script to use, depeding on Solaris version to install,
  either <tt>peanut-sol10-cd-install1.simics</tt>
  for Solaris 10, <tt>peanut-sol9-cd-install1.simics</tt>
  for Solaris 9, or <tt>peanut-sol8-cd-install1.simics</tt>
  for Solaris 8. 
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  Set the path to the CD image in the simics script. The line
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    $cdrom_path = "sol-10-u2-ga-sparc-v1.iso"
</pre>
  should be changed to reflect the location and name of the CD image
  for stage one of the installlation. It can either be an ISO image file, or
  a CD-ROM device file (Linux and Solaris host only).
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  Start the first installation script, for example:
  <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  $ <b>./simics targets/sunfire/peanut-sol10-cd-install1.simics</b>
  </pre>
  and wait for it to complete. This may take several hours, depending on the
  performance of the host machine. 
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  When the script stops, installation from the first CD is finished, and
  Solaris has tried to reboot the system. Since Simics does not support system
  reboot for this architecture, exit Simics at this point.
<p>
  If the installation is performed from a real CD, it is now time to change
  disc in the drive. Also make sure that the path to the CD is correct in the
  second install script.
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  Now run the second script in the same way as the first, this script may also
  take a few hours to complete.
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  When the second script has stopped, run the third and last one. This script
  only takes a few minutes to finish.
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  When the third script has stopped the installation is ready. The newly
  created disk image has the following file name:
  <tt>peanut-sol&lt;version&gt;-install.disk</tt>. There are also
  a number of <em>persistent state</em> files.
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  To boot a machine with the newly installed Solaris OS, run the
  <tt>peanut-common.simics</tt> and make sure that the variable
  <tt>$os</tt> is set to <tt>"solaris10"</tt>,
  <tt>"solaris9"</tt> or <tt>"solaris8"</tt> depending on
  the operating system version installed). Add a line like the following first
  in that simics script:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  $os = "solaris10"
</pre>
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  An optional last step is to compress the disk image with the
  <tt>craff</tt> utility to save some disk space.
  </li>
<p>
  </ol>

<p>
The files <tt>walnut-cd-install1.simics</tt> and
<tt>walnut-cd-install2.simics</tt>, that are supplied with the
walnut simulated machine provide a way to install an operating system
on Simics from a bootable CD-ROM. Before starting, please read the instructions
in <tt>walnut-cd-install1.simics</tt>.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> If you plan to mount your finished disk using loopback, you should make
sure that each simulated file system is small enough to fit uncompressed on
your local machine.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> The instructions given here for installing from CD-ROM also apply to
installing from DVD. The ISO format is the same for data CD-ROMs and DVDs and
you can install from an ISO image of any size using the
<b>new-file-cdrom</b> command described below.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
<ol>
<li>Create an ISO image file of the bootable CD-ROM you want to install from.
Linux example:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
$ <b>dd if=/dev/cdrom of=myos.iso</b>
</pre>
<p>
On Windows, a third-party tool is necessary to create the ISO image.  For more
information on how to deal with CD-ROMs and other disk images, see the chapter
titled <i>Managing Disks, Floppies, and CD-ROMs</i> in the <i>Simics User
Guide</i>.  On Linux and Solaris hosts it is not necessary to create the ISO
file, Simics can also access the actual CD directly by specifying the device
file.
</li>
<p>
<li>Run Simics with the first script:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
$ <b>./simics targets/sunfire/walnut-cd-install1.simics</b>
</pre>    
</li>
<p>
<li>Insert the ISO image with the OS into the simulated CD-ROM drive with the
following two commands, and then start the simulation.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>new-file-cdrom myos.iso</b>
cdrom 'myos' created
simics&gt; <b>cd0.insert myos</b>
simics&gt; <b>c</b>
</pre>
<p>
To install from a CD that is inserted in the host CD-ROM unit instead of from
an ISO file, replace the first line in the example above with the following
example line. The argument <tt>/dev/cdrom</tt> is the path to the device and
may be different depending on your host system. Note that this is <b>not</b>
the path to the files on the CD, such as <tt>/mnt/cdrom</tt>. Accessing a CD
on the host is not supported on Windows hosts.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>new-file-cdrom "/dev/cdrom" myos</b>
</pre>
</li>
<p>
<li>When the installation is finished, shutdown the simulated machine (a lot of
OSes do this automatically when the install is complete). The way to shutdown
the machine differs between operating systems, but there is usually some help
available on the screen.
</li>
<p>
<li>
You may get a error message from Simics saying that reboot/suspend/shutdown
is an experimental feature, but that can be ignored. At this point save the
persistent state of the machine:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>save-persistent-state install-phase1.state</b>
</pre>
The persistent state contains all information on the disk, as well as the
contents of NVRAMs and other devices that survive reboot. Finally exit Simics.
</li>
<p>
<li>Start Simics using the second script, which will boot from the
installation disk and not from the CD-ROM.  If the CD-ROM is needed, it has to
be inserted into the machine in the same way as in the first phase of the
installation.
<p>
If the installer program in the simulated machine asks for the path to the
CD-ROM, give the path in the simulated machine. Since there is only one
CD-ROM in the default machine setup, this should be quite easy to identify.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
$ <b>./simics targets/sunfire/walnut-cd-install2.simics</b>
</pre>    
<p>
Then, before starting the simulation, load the persistent state that was saved
at the end of the first phase.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>load-persistent-state install-phase1.state</b>
</pre>
</li>
<p>
<li>Since there are probably changes done to the disk in the second phase as
well, reboot the simulated machine, and when it has completed the shut down,
save the persistent state to a new file.</li>
<p>
<li>If there are several reboots during the installation process, save a new
state file each time. Only the most recent one has to be loaded when Simics is
restarted, but all state files must be kept since they depend on each other.
</li>
<p>
<li>When the install is complete, you will have one or more persistent state
files. To create a single one, use the <i>checkpoint-merge</i> utility to join
them. After verifying that the combined persistent state works, the previous
ones can be removed.</li>
<p>
<li>
To run the machine with the newly installed operating system, start the
<tt>walnut-common.simics</tt> and load the most recent persistent
state file, or the combined state file that was created using the
checkpoint-merge utility.</li>
<p>
<li>If you want to change the number of processors in the machine or some
other machine parameters, you can do so now (provided that you have installed
support for multiple processors or other hardware during your install). See
chapter <a class="jdocu" href="topic2.html#label33">3.6</a>.</li>
