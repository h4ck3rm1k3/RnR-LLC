<a name="label456"></a><h3 class="jdocu">7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notes on Solaris for SunFire</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
For information about system administration of Solaris, see the
<a class="jdocu" href="http://docs.sun.com" target="_top">http://docs.sun.com</a> web site.
</li>
<p>
<li>
Remember to boot with the <tt>-r</tt> flag after changing a machine
configuration. Example:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>system_cmp0.set-prom-env boot-command "boot disk1 -rv"</b>
</pre>
</li>    
<p>
<li>
Booting from a disk in a different location that it was setup for is not
recommended. It is possible, but requires some knowledge of Solaris
administration.
</li>
<p>
<li>
When using multiple Ethernet adapters in a Serengeti system, all will be
assigned the same system-wide MAC address by Solaris. To avoid this, the OBP
variable <tt>local-mac-address?</tt> can be set to <tt>true</tt>. Setting this
variable from the Simics command-line is done using the following command:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>system_cmp0.set-prom-env local-mac-address? true</b>
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="label457"></a><h3 class="jdocu">7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple Network Devices</h3 class="jdocu">


By default, only the first network device is connected to a simulated network
when running with <tt>$create_network</tt> set to <tt>yes</tt>. To run with
multiple network devices, the <b>&lt;device&gt;.connect</b> command should be
used to connect each additional device to the Ethernet link. If several
network devices have the same MAC address (default unless the
<tt>local-mac-address?</tt>  OBP variable is set) they must be connected to
different simulated links.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
There is a bug in the 2.4.0 - 2.4.18 versions of the Linux linux kernel that
disables serial interrupts some time into the boot. This bug is not present in
the 2.2 kernels, or in 2.4.19 and newer.
<p>
The workaround, already applied to the bagle machine, is to set the
<tt>workaround_linux_bug</tt> attribute to 1 in the <tt>fhc0</tt> object.
</li>
<p>
 <li>
A bug in all Linux kernels prior to version 2.4.19 requires the machine to have
devices on both SYSIO controllers on an SBus board. The workaround is to add
some device to slot 1 or 2 that is empty by default in Simics. This workaround
is already present in the bagle machine configuration.
<p>
On real machines there is an on-board SOC controller on one of the SYSIOs,
and 'fas' + 'hme' on the other, hiding this bug. But Simics does not model the
SOC device.
</li>
<p>
<li>
SuSE Linux 7.3 incorrectly expects PC keyboard codes although the kernel
correctly has identified a Sun Type 5 keyboard. The following workaround, that
is already applied to the bagle scripts, will allow keyboard input in the
graphical console. (Note: not needed for the text based xterm console). If X
is started, the <tt>send_pc_codes</tt> attribute should be set to 0 again since
the XFree86 keyboard handler uses Sun Type 5 keycodes.
</li>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
@conf.kbd.send_pc_codes = 1
</pre>
<p>
<li>
Linux 2.4.0 - 2.4.18 does not map interrupts correctly for devices below a
PCI-to-PCI bridge. As a result, most PCI boards listed earlier in this document
may not work when running Linux on the simulated machine. This problem is
fixed starting with version 2.4.19 of the Linux kernel.
</li>
<p>
<li>
Some versions of SILO (The Linux loader for SPARC) allocates large MMU pages
for the kernel. There is a bug in many Linux kernels causing it to panic with
"Trap 5", when mapped on a large MMU page.
<p>
Detailed information: The kernel tries to find the TLB entry of the current PC
by masking the PC with an 8K page mask (0x1fff). But SILO has mapped the kernel
in an 4M page. Since the PC isn't in the first 8K of this page when this
happens, the kernel will never find any matching TLB entry and it then panics
by running a "ta 5" instruction.
<p>
This bug is known to exist in early 2.6 kernels, at least up to 2.6.8. There
exists a workaround, but it has to be adapted for each kernel version.

<a name="label459"></a><h3 class="jdocu">7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the Processor Clock Frequency</h3 class="jdocu">


<a name="label460"></a> 
<a name="label461"></a>
<a name="label462"></a>
<p>
The clock frequency of a simulated processor can be set arbitrarily in
Simics.  This will not affect the actual speed of simulation, but it
will affect the number of instructions that need to be executed for a
certain amount of simulated time to pass.  If your execution only
depends on executing a certain number of instructions, increasing the clock frequency will take
the same amount of host time (but a shorter amount of target
time). However, if there are time based delays of some kind in the simulation,
these will take  longer to execute. 
<p>
At a simulated 1 MHz, one million target instructions will correspond to a
simulated second (assuming the simple default timing of one cycle per
instruction). At 100 MHz, on the other hand, it will take 100 million
target instructions to complete a simulated second. So with a higher clock
frequency, less simulated target time is going to pass for a certain
period of host execution time.
<p>
If Simics is used to emulate an interactive system (especially one
with a graphical user interface) it is a good idea to set the clock
frequency quite low.  Keyboard and mouse inputs events are handled by
periodic interrupts in most operating systems, using a higher clock
frequency will result in longer delays between invocations of periodic
interrupts.  Thus, the simulated system will feel slower in its user
response, and update the mouse cursor position etc. less frequently.
If this is a problem, the best technique for running experiments at a
high clock frequency is to first complete the configuration of the
machine using a low clock frequency.  Save all configuration changes
to a disk diff (like when installing operating systems).  Then change
the configuration to use a higher a clock frequency and reboot the
target machine.
<p>
Note that for a lightly-loaded machine (for example, working at an
interactive prompt on a serial console to an embedded Linux system),
Simics will often execute quickly enough at the real target clock
frequency that there is no need to artifically lower it.
