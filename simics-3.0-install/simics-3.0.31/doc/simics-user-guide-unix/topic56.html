<h4 class="jdocu">11.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example of Distributed Simulation and Network</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
This section is an extension of the First Steps guide in Chapter
<a class="jdocu" href="topic12.html#label70">4</a>.
<p>
Simics allows you to distribute a simulation on several computers.
The typical setup is to simulate one or more machines on each node.
Simics will synchronize the nodes so that they will have the same
simulated time elapsed, and also provides a way to share
Ethernet links.
<p>
In this guide we will start two Simicses on the same computer and
connect them together.
<p>
Create two terminals, and 
launch the <tt>ebony-linux-firststeps.simics</tt> in both shells.
To be able distinguish the machines, we change the Simics prompt.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
joe@computer: ebony$ <b>./simics ebony-linux-firststeps.simics</b>
[...]
simics&gt;  <b>@SIM_set_prompt("simics1&gt;  ")</b>
simics1&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
Likewise, in the second terminal:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
joe@computer: ebony$ <b>./simics ebony-linux-firststeps.simics</b>
[...]
simics&gt;  <b>@SIM_set_prompt("simics2&gt;  ")</b>
simics2&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
Select the first simulation again, and enter the following commands in the
Simics console:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics1&gt;  <b>new-central-server</b>
[central_server info] Listening to port 1909
[central_server info] Listening to unix socket [...]
Created central_server
simics1&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
This will create the <b>central_server</b> object, which acts as the hub
in our distributed simulation. All simulations will connect to the central
server.
The next step is to actually connect the first simulation to the server:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics1&gt;  <b>connect-central obj = central_server</b>
Created central_client
[central_server info] New connection with id 0
Connected to Simics Central
simics1&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
<b>connect-central</b> will create a <b>central-client</b> object
named <b>central_client</b> and connect it to our <b>central_server</b>
object. Note the usage of the <i>obj</i> argument. Normally, we would
supply the host name of the computer running the central server.
However, since
the client and server are running in the same Simics process, we connect
directly to the <b>central_server</b> object.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> You can at any time run <b>central_server.info</b>
or <b>central_client.info</b> to view the current status.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
Now we are going to connect the other simulation to the central as well.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics2&gt;  <b>connect-central localhost</b>
Created central_client
[central_client info] Connected to server
Connected to Simics Central
simics2&gt;  <b>central_client.info</b>
Information about central_client [class central-client]
=======================================================
                Identification : computer (process 2013)
                        Server : /tmp/simics-central.joe
simics2&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
Since the <b>central-server</b> is running in another Simics
process, on the same computer, we supply <tt>localhost</tt> as the
host name.
<p>
Now both simulations are synchronized. However, the simulated machines are not
able to talk to each other yet.
<p>
Both machines need a simulated Ethernet link.
Create a <b>ethernet-link</b> to which we
connect the simulated network card.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics2&gt;  <b>new-ethernet-link</b>
Created ethernet-link ethlink0
simics2&gt;  <b>emac0.connect ethlink0</b>
simics2&gt;  <b>ethlink0.info</b>
Information about ethlink0 [class ethernet-link]
================================================
[...]
                  Distribution : local
[...]
simics2&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
The first command will create the <b>ethlink0</b> object, and the second
command connects it to the simulated network card. The
<b>&lt;ethernet-link&gt;.info</b> shows two important things:
the link is connected to the simulated network card, but
<b>not</b> shared via the central yet. We will do that now:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics2&gt;  <b>ethlink0-&gt;central = central_client</b>
[ethlink0 info] Adjusting latency to 0.01 s [...]
simics2&gt;  <b>ethlink0.info</b>
[...]
                  Distribution : global
[...]
simics2&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
Distribution has now changed from <i>local</i> to <i>global</i>.
<p>
Finally, we must also connect the first simulation to the simulated network.
Switch to the first Simics instance and enter the following commands:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics1&gt;  <b>new-ethernet-link</b>
Created ethernet-link ethlink0
simics1&gt;  <b>emac0.connect ethlink0</b>
simics1&gt;  <b>ethlink0-&gt;central = central_client</b>
[ethlink0 info] Adjusting latency to 0.01 s [...]
simics1&gt;  <b>ethlink0.info</b>
[...]
                 Local devices : &lt;0:0&gt; emac0
                Remote devices : &lt;1:0&gt; emac0
[...]
simics1&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
Here we see that the network card on the other simulated machine is
added to the device list.
Hopefully, the two machines are now able to talk to each
other. Before we try anything, there is one more thing we must do. Since the
two simulated machines are identical, they are assigned the same IP address.
Thus, we must change the IP address on one of them.
<p>
Boot both machines by giving the <b>continue</b> command.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> You must resume <i>both</i> simulations. If you resume only
one simulation it will appear to hang. This is because the simulations are
synchronized through the central server.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
Then, in one of the consoles, enter the following command:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
root@firststeps: ~# <b>ifconfig eth0 10.10.0.51</b>
root@firststeps: ~#
</pre>
<p>
This will change the IP on that machine to 10.10.0.51. The other machine should
have the IP address 10.10.0.50. Try pinging (from 10.10.0.51):
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
root@firststeps: ~# <b>ping -c 2 10.10.0.50</b>
PING 10.10.0.50 (10.10.0.50): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.10.0.50: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=10.0 ms
64 bytes from 10.10.0.50: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=10.0 ms

--- 10.10.0.50 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 10.0/10.0/10.0 ms
root@firststeps: ~#
</pre>
