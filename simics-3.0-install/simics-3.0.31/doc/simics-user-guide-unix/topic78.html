<h4 class="jdocu">16.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalling Memory Transactions</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
When an object attached to the <em>timing-model</em> interface receives a
memory-transaction, it is allowed to modify the timing of the transaction by
returning a <em>stall time</em> (as a number of processor cycles). Upon
receiving a non-zero stall time, Simics will block the transaction for that number
of processor cycles before executing it.
<p>
This behavior is a key to modeling caches and memory hierarchies in Simics,
particularly in multi-processor simulations. A complete description of cache
simulation in Simics is available in chapter <a class="jdocu" href="topic86.html#label517">18</a>. The <em>Simics Programming Guide</em> explains how to make
your own timing-model object to observe and stall memory transactions, and
provides more information about the different types of stalling available.
<p>
To be able to stall transactions, the simulation must be started with the
<i>-stall</i> flag. This will tell Simics to set up the processors so that
stalling is allowed. It is otherwise disabled for performance reasons.
<p>
Stalling a transaction is not always possible, depending on the processor model
you are using in the simulation:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>UltraSPARC processors can stall both data accesses and instruction
fetches.</li>
<p>
<li>x86, PowerPC and MIPS processors can stall data accesses.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> As mentioned above, a transaction may go through several memory-spaces
in hierarchical order before being executed. Each of these memory-spaces may
have a timing-model connected to them. However, if the transaction is stalled
by one timing model, the other timing models may see the transaction being
reissued before it is executed.<hr class="jdocu_note">
