<h4 class="jdocu">4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Files into a Simulated System</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
A full systems simulation can be run completely isolated, but Simics also
provides a way for the simulated system to access files that are located
on the host, i.e, your real computer.
<p>
<i>SimicsFS</i> is a Linux kernel filesystem module that
talks to a simulated device, namely a corresponding Simics
module. Our <tt>firststeps</tt> machine is
prepared with <b>simicsfs</b> support; just mount <tt>/host</tt>
to access it.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
root@firststeps: ~# <b>mount /host</b>
[simicsfs] mounted
root@firststeps: ~# <b>ls /host</b>
bin         etc         lost+found  net         root        sys
boot        home        media       opt         sbin        tmp
[...]
root@firststeps: ~#
</pre>
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Support for SimicsFS have to be
installed in the
target system, which means it have to be modified. Modules exists
for the Linux 2.4 and 2.6 series. On other systems a module has
to be written in order to get SimicsFS to work.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
As write support is experimental, SimicsFS is mounted read-only
by default. To be able to transfer files from
the simulation to the host, mount it read-write. 
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
root@firststeps: ~# <b>mount /host -o remount,rw</b>
root@firststeps: ~# <b>cp /proc/cpuinfo /host/tmp/cpuinfo</b>
root@firststeps: ~# <b>umount /host</b>
root@firststeps: ~#
</pre>
<p>
Now, we can read the file on our host machine.
<p>

<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
<b>[press control-C]</b>
simics&gt;  <b>!cat /tmp/cpuinfo</b>
processor       : 0
cpu             : 440GP Rev. C
revision        : 4.129 (pvr 4012 0481)
bogomips        : 799.53
vendor          : IBM
machine         : Ebony
simics&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> The <b>!</b> command will interpret the rest of the
command line as if it was given in a shell.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>

Sometimes it is desirable to limit the accessible files to a certain directory.
This is done with the <b>&lt;hostfs&gt;.root</b> command. Set the
root to the Simics installation directory.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
<b>[press control-C]</b>
simics&gt;  <b>hfs0.root sim-&gt;simics_base</b>
simics&gt;  <b>c</b>
</pre>
<p>
Now transfer the file to be used in next section into the 
simulated system.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
root@firststeps: ~# <b>mount /host</b>
[simicsfs] mounted
root@firststeps: ~# <b>cp /host/targets/ebony/images/debug_example .</b>
root@firststeps: ~#
</pre>
