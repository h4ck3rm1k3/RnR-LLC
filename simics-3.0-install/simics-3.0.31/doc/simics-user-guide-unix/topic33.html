<h4 class="jdocu">7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using SimicsFS</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
SimicsFS gives you access to the file system of your real computer inside the
simulated machine. This greatly simplifies the process of importing files into
the simulated machine.
<p>
SimicsFS is supported for targets running Solaris 7, 8, 9 and 10, and Linux
kernel versions 2.0 to 2.6.
<p>
SimicsFS is installed on disk dumps distributed by Virtutech. For users booting
from other disks, there are a number of steps needed to configure the target
system. This process is target OS specific, and is described in the following
sections.
<p>
SimicsFS is not fully functional on all simulated operating systems. The
following limitations apply:

<p>
For Linux kernel versions prior to 2.4, the SimicsFS kernel module is called
<tt>hostfs</tt> rather than <tt>simicsfs</tt>, so for those kernels just
replace the <tt>simicsfs</tt> part in file names with <tt>hostfs</tt> in the
following description. When the instructions ask you to copy files into the
simulated machine, one of the methods described elsewhere must be used (e.g.,
network, loopback disk access, or CD-ROM).
<p>
<ul>
<p>
    <li>Since there are lots of different Linux kernels, and a module has to
    match the kernel version, Simics does not provide any pre-compiled
    <tt>simicsfs</tt> modules. To build your own <tt>simicsfs</tt> module,
    download the SimicsFS source code from
    <a class="jdocu" href="https://www.simics.net/pub/simicsfs.tar.gz" target="_top">https://www.simics.net/pub/simicsfs.tar.gz</a>.  The
    <tt>README_2.4</tt> and <tt>README_2.6</tt> files in the archive
    will explain how to add the SimicsFS sources to the Linux kernel tree and
    compile it with the kernel you want to use.</li>
<p>
    <li>Create a new directory
    <tt>/lib/modules/</tt><em>version</em><tt>/kernel/fs/simicsfs/</tt> on the
    simulated machine, where <tt></tt><em>version</em><tt></tt> is the simulated
    machine's kernel version.</li>
<p>
    <li>Copy the newly compiled SimicsFS module file to the directory
    <tt>/lib/modules/</tt><em>version</em><tt>/kernel/fs/simicsfs/</tt> on the
    simulated machine, and make sure it is called <tt>simicsfs.o</tt> for
    Linux 2.4 (and older), and <tt>simicsfs.ko</tt> for Linux 2.6.</li>
<p>
    <li>Create the mount point on the simulated machine with <tt>mkdir
    /host</tt>.</li>
<p>
    <li>Add the following line in the simulated machine's
    <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> (replace <tt>/host</tt> with your
    mount point):
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
special      /host      simicsfs     noauto,ro      0 0
</pre>
    </li>
    <hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> To use the experimental write support, change <tt>ro</tt> into
    <tt>rw</tt>.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
    <li>Mount SimicsFS with the command <tt>mount /host</tt> on the simulated
    machine.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
SimicsFS should now be working, and by issuing <tt>ls /host</tt> on the
simulated machine, you should get a listing of the host machine's files.
<p>

<p>
These are the steps needed to install SimicsFS on a simulated Solaris, version
7, 8, 9 and 10. When the instructions ask you to copy files into the simulated
machine, one of the methods described above must be used (network, loopback
disk access, CD-ROM...). Note that the driver included with earlier Simics
distributions was called <tt>hostfs</tt> and not <tt>simicsfs</tt>.
<p>
<ul>
<p>
    <li>Create a new directory <tt>/usr/lib/fs/simicsfs/</tt> on the
    simulated machine.</li>
<p>
    <li>Copy the file <tt>[simics]/import/sun4u/mount_simicsfs</tt> to
    <tt>/usr/lib/fs/simicsfs/</tt> on the simulated disk, and rename
    it to <tt>mount</tt>.</li>
<p>
    <li>Copy the file
    <tt>[simics]/import/sun4u/simicsfs-sol</tt><em>version</em><tt></tt> (where
    <tt></tt><em>version</em><tt></tt> matches the version of Solaris running on your
    simulated machine) to <tt>/usr/kernel/fs/sparcv9/</tt>
    on the simulated machine, and rename it to <tt>simicsfs</tt>.</li>
<p>

    <li>Add the following line to <tt>/etc/vfstab</tt> on the
    simulated disk:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simicsfs  -       /host   simicsfs  -       no      -
</pre>
<p>
    </li>
<p>
    <li>Create the mount point on the simulated machine with <tt>mkdir
    /host</tt>.</li>
<p>
    <li>When the simulated system is running, issue the command:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
mount /host
</pre>
    </li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>

You should now be able to do <tt>ls /host</tt> on the simulated system to get a
list of the files on the host.
<p>

<a name="label184"></a><h5 class="jdocu">7.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using SimicsFS</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>

By default, the simulated machine can access the entire file tree of the host
computer from the mount point (typically <tt>/host</tt>).
<p>

This can sometimes be inconvenient (or dangerous, if the simulator runs
untrusted or unreliable code), so it is recommended to set the directory that
is visible to the simulated machine using the <b>&lt;hostfs&gt;.root</b>
command, e.g.:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>hfs0.root /home/alice/sandbox</b>
</pre>
<p>
The command will take effect next time SimicsFS is mounted.
<p>
Because of implementation limitations, it is recommended that SimicsFS be
chiefly used to copy files into and out from the target machine. In particular,
executing binaries residing on the host machine may be unreliable.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> When saving a checkpoint while a SimicsFS is mounted, take care that the
host files that were used at that time are kept unchanged when the checkpoint
is loaded.<hr class="jdocu_note">
