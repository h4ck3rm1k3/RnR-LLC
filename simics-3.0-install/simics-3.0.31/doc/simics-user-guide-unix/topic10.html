<p>
    Each release of Simics has a unique three digit version number,
    e.g. 2.2.7. A change in the first or second number is defined as a major
    release. Changing the third number is a minor release. Major releases are
    generally distributed to provide significant product improvements. Minor
    releases are generally distributed when adding new simulation models or for
    error corrections.
    <p>
    A release with an odd second number or with a letter in the version
    e.g. 2.3.2 or 3.1b.0 is a development release and is not subject to any
    support commitment. Development releases are generally distributed to
    provide early access to new functionality.
