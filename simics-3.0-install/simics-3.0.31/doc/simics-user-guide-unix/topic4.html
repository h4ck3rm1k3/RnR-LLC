<p>
   This is a list of terms that have a special meaning in Simics documentation.
<p>
   <ul>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label22">callback</a></b> &#8212; A user-defined function
   installed so that it will be called from Simics, for example when a
   <i>hap</i> occurs.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label23">checkpoint</a></b> &#8212; The state of simulation, 
   saved as a number of files, that can be loaded to continue simulation
   at the point the checkpoint was saved.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b>CLI</b> &#8212; See Command Line Interface.</li>
<p>
   <li> <a name="label24"></a><b>Command Line Interface</b> &#8212;
   The default Simics command-line (user interface). It uses a simple language
   implemented in Python, and is variously called the Simics "front end" or the
   "CLI".</li>
<p>
   <li><b><a name="label25">component</a></b> &#8212;
   A component is typically the smallest hardware unit that can be
   used when configuring a real machine, and examples include
   motherboards, PCI cards, hard disks, and backplanes. Components
   are usually implemented in Simics using several <i>configuration
   objects</i>.
   </li>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label26">configuration</a></b> &#8212; A configuration is a
   description of a target architecture, and is loaded into Simics with the
   <i>read-configuration</i> command. Note that a configuration can also
   include the state of the target, and saved from within Simics using the
   <i>write-configuration</i> command, in which case it provides a portable
   <i>checkpoint</i> facility.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label27">configuration object</a></b> &#8212;
   Simics's configuration system is object-oriented: a simulated
   machine is represented as a set of <em>components</em>, which
   are implemented by <em>configuration objects</em>. 
   </li>   
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label28">context</a></b> &#8212; Each processor has a
   <em><a name="label29">current context</a></em><a name="label30"></a>, which
   represents the virtual address space currently visible to code running on
   the processor.
   </li>   
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label31">craff</a></b> &#8212; <b>C</b>ompressed <b>R</b>andom
   <b>A</b>ccess <b>F</b>ile <b>F</b>ormat, used to save raw data for objects,
   such as disk dumps and target memory contents. A separate utility allows you
   to compress input data to Simics, such as target disk dumps, in a format
   that Simics can use directly.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label32">cycle</a></b> &#8212; The smallest unit of time in
   Simics. When using Simics in its default mode, the cycle count is usually
   the same as the <i>step</i> count, but this can be changed in various ways
   to improve the fidelity of the simulation.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label33">device</a></b> &#8212; A module modeling a hardware
   device.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label34">event</a></b> &#8212; A Simics event occurs at some
   predefined point of simulated time. Time can be specified either as a number
   of steps on a simulated processor, or a number of simulated clock
   cycles.</li>
<p>

   <li> <b><a name="label35">extension</a></b> &#8212; A module which is not a device, but
   adds features to Simics; e.g., a statistics collection module.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label36">hap</a></b> &#8212; Defined simulation or simulator state
   changes that may trigger callback functions.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label37">Hindsight</a>&trade;</b> &#8212; The technology utilized
   by Simics to achieve reverse execution.</li>
<p>
   <li> <a name="label38"></a><b>host addresses</b> &#8212; Logical memory
   addresses on the host machine; i.e., addresses in the virtual memory space
   that the simulator itself is running in.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b>host</b> &#8212; The machine the simulator (Simics) is running
   on.</li>
<p>

   <li> <a name="label39"></a><b>logical addresses</b> &#8212; Memory
   addresses corresponding to virtual or logical addresses on the target
   machine. These are typically translated by a memory management unit (MMU) to
   physical addresses.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b>memory hierarchy</b> &#8212; A user defined module that simulates
   caches and timing of memory operations. Interfaces to Simics using
   a memory transaction data structure.</li>
<p>
   <li> <a name="label40"></a>
   <b>module</b> &#8212; A dynamically linked library or a script that
   interfaces to Simics and extends the functionality of the simulator. A
   module is either an <i>extension</i> or a <i>device</i>.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b>object</b> &#8212; See Configuration object.</li>
<p>


   <li> <a name="label41"></a>
        <b>physical addresses</b> &#8212; Memory addresses corresponding to
   physical/real addresses on the target machine; i.e., the actual
   address bits put out on the memory bus.</li>
<p>

   <li> <b><a name="label42">Python</a></b> &#8212; An object oriented script
   language. See <a class="jdocu" href="http://www.python.org" target="_top">http://www.python.org</a> for more info.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label43">reverse execution</a></b> &#8212; Execution of a simulation
   backwards in simulated time.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b>Simics console</b> &#8212; The Simics console is a text console
   where you can issue commands to Simics, and where Simics will display
   status information, log messages, and printout from issued commands.
   The Simics console is available in all Simics user interfaces but
   in slightly different versions.
   </li>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label44">SimicsFS</a></b> &#8212; A "magic" feature allowing simple
   accesses from a simulated system to the host's real file
   system. Pre-configured disk dumps use the <tt>/host</tt> mount point for
   the magic device. This is presently only supported when running Solaris or
   Linux on the target machine.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b>Simics object</b> &#8212; See Configuration object.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label45">STC</a></b> &#8212; Simulator Translation Cache. A mechanism
   in the simulator to improve simulator performance. Among other things, it
   filters uninteresting memory accesses from the memory hierarchy.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label46">step</a></b> &#8212; An issued instruction that completes or
   causes an exception, or an external interrupt.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b>system level instruction set simulation</b> &#8212; The effect of
   every single instruction is simulated both on user and supervisor
   level. At any instruction, the simulation can be stopped and state
   can be inspected (and changed).</li>
<p>
   <li> <b>target</b> &#8212; The simulated machine.</li>
<p>

   <li> <b>virtual machine</b> &#8212; The simulated machine.</li>
<p>
   <li> <b><a name="label47">workspace</a></b> &#8212; The primary area where the
   user's files (scripts, checkpoints, source code, etc.) are placed.
   </li>
<p>
