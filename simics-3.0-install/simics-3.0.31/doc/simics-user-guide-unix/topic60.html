    This chapter describes how to use <b>gdb-remote</b>, a
    Simics module that lets you connect a GDB session running on your
    host machine to the simulated machine using GDB's remote debugging
    protocol, and use GDB to debug software running on the target
    machine.
<p>
    If you load the <b>gdb-remote</b> module in Simics, you
    can use the remote debugging feature of <a name="label386">GDB</a>, the GNU
    debugger, to connect one or more GDB processes to Simics over
    TCP/IP. In order to do this, you need a GDB compiled to support
    the simulation's target architecture on whichever host you're
    running. The <b><a name="label387">gdb-remote</a></b> module only
    supports version 5.0 or later of GDB, but other versions may work
    as well. Unfortunately GDB's remote protocol does not include any
    version checking, so the behavior is undefined if you use other
    versions. For information on how to obtain and compile GDB, see
    section <a class="jdocu" href="#label393">12.2.3</a>.
<p>

    To connect a GDB session to Simics, start your Simics session and
    run the <b>new-gdb-remote</b> command, optionally followed by
    a TCP/IP port number, which defaults to 9123 otherwise. This will
    automatically load the <b>gdb-remote</b> module.
<p>
    When a configuration is loaded, Simics will start listening to incoming
    TCP/IP connections on the specified port. Run the simulated machine up to
    the point where you want to connect GDB. To inspect a user process or
    dynamically loaded parts of the kernel, the easiest solution might be to
    insert magic instructions at carefully chosen points. For static kernel
    debugging, a simple breakpoint on a suitable address will solve the
    problem.
<p>
    <hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> When debugging the start-up phase of an operating system, it might
    happen that gdb gets confused by the machine state and disconnects when you
    try to connect. In this case, execute a few instructions and try again.
    <hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
    Once Simics is in the desired state, start your GDB session, load any
    debugging information into it, and then connect it to Simics using the
    <b>target remote <i>host</i>:<i>port</i></b> command, where
    <i>host</i> is the host Simics is running on, and <i>port</i> is
    the TCP/IP port number as described above. Here is a short sample session
    using <i>bagle</i>, a Sun UltraSPARC machine running Linux:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
(gdb) <b>set architecture sparc:v9a</b>
(gdb) <b>symbol-file vmlinux</b>
Reading symbols from vmlinux...done.
(gdb) <b>target remote localhost:9123</b>
Remote debugging using localhost:9123
time_init () at /usr/src/linux/include/asm/time.h:52
(gdb)
</pre>
<p>
    <hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> For some architectures, you need to give a command to GDB
    before connecting (the <b>set architecture</b> command in the
    session above). These are tabulated in the reference manual's
    section on <b>gdb-remote</b>, and will also be printed on
    the Simics console when you run <b>new-gdb-remote</b>.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
    From this point, you can use GDB to control the target machine by entering
    normal GDB commands such as <b>continue</b>, <b>step</b>,
    <b>stepi</b>, <b>info regs</b>, <b>breakpoint</b>, etc.
<p>
    Note that while a remote GDB session is connected to Simics, the Simics
    prompt behaves a little differently when it comes to stopping and resuming
    the simulation. While the GDB session is at prompt, it is impossible to
    continue the simulation from within Simics (e.g., by using the
    <b>continue</b> command). However, once you continue the execution from
    GDB, you can stop it from GDB (by pressing control-C), which causes the
    simulation to stop and makes both GDB and Simics return to their prompts,
    or you can stop the simulation from the Simics prompt (also by pressing
    control-C). This only makes Simics return to prompt, while GDB will still
    think the target program is running. In this state, you should continue the
    simulation from the Simics prompt before attempting to use GDB.
<p>
    You can also force GDB back to prompt using the <b>gdb0.signal 2</b>
    command in Simics, which tells the GDB session that the simulated machine
    got a <tt>SIGINT</tt> signal.  <b>gdb0</b> here refers to the
    configuration object created on the fly when the GDB session connected to
    Simics. You can connect several GDB sessions to one Simics; each connection
    will be associated to one <b>gdb<em>nn</em></b> object.
<p>
    Since GDB isn't the most stable software, especially when using
    remote debugging, it unfortunately hangs now and then. To force
    Simics to disconnect a dead connection, you can use the
    <b>gdb0.disconnect</b> command.
<p>
    Note that the <b>gdb-remote</b> module does not have any
    high-level information about the OS being run inside Simics. This means
    that in order to examine memory or disassemble code, the data or code you
    want to look at has to be in the active TLB.
<p>
    <hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> When using <b>gdb-remote</b> with targets supporting
    multiple address sizes (such as x86-64 and SPARC), you must have a GDB
    compiled for the larger address size. For SPARC, run GDB's configure script
    with the <tt>--target=sparc64-sun-solaris2.8</tt> option.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>

    <a name="label388"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remote GDB and Shared Libraries</h5 class="jdocu">

    
    <a name="label389"></a>
<p>
    It takes some work to figure out how to load symbol tables at the
    correct offsets for relocatable object modules in GDB. This is done
    automatically for normal (non-remote) targets, but for the remote
    target, you have to do it yourself. You need to find out the
    actual address at which the shared module is mapped in the current
    context on the simulated machine, and then calculate the offset to
    use for GDB's <b>add-symbol-file</b> command.
<p>
    To find the addresses of the shared libraries mapped into a
    process' memory space under Solaris, use the
    <b>/usr/proc/bin/pmap <em>pid</em></b> command. The start address of
    the text segment can be obtained from the <tt>Addr</tt> field in
    the <tt>.text</tt> line of the output from <b>dump -h
    <i>file</i></b>.
<p>
    Under Linux, the list of <a name="label390">memory mappings</a> can be found in the
    file <tt>/proc/</tt><em>pid</em><tt>/maps</tt> (plain text format). The
    <tt>VMA</tt> column of the <tt>.text</tt> line of the output from
    <b>objdump -h <i>file</i></b> contains the start address of the text
    segment.
<p>
    Using these two values, <i>map address</i> and <i>text address</i>, you
    should use <i>map address</i> + <i>text address</i> as the offset to
    <b>add-symbol-file</b> (it has to be done this way to compensate for
    how GDB handles symbol loading).
<p>
    The following example uses a SPARC running Linux (<tt>sim-sh#</tt> denotes
    the shell in the simulated computer):
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
sim-sh# <b>ps</b>

    From this output, we derive that the bash process with PID 461 has

    <tt>0x70040000</tt>. The <tt>.text</tt> symbols starts at address
    <tt>0x1e400</tt>, so if we connect GDB to Simics we have to add
    the symbols with an offset of <tt>0x70040000 + 0x1e400 =
    0x7005e400</tt>. Before running the following commands, we stopped
    Simics using control-C while it was executing code in the bash
    process:

    <a name="label391"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using GDB with Hindsight</h5 class="jdocu">

    
    <a name="label392"></a>
<p>
    <b>gdb-remote</b> supports an extension to the GDB
    remote protocol that allows the debugger to control the Hindsight
    functions in Simics. An unmodified GDB does not know about this
    extension, however; if you compile GDB yourself, you will need to
    start from patched sources, available at
    <a class="jdocu" href="https://www.simics.net/pub/" target="_top">https://www.simics.net/pub/</a> (see section <a class="jdocu" href="#label393">12.2.3</a>). Some Simics packages come with a
    pre-compiled GDB with Hindsight support; you can find it in
    <tt></tt><i>host</i><tt>/sys/bin/</tt>.
<p>
    The patch adds a number of Hindsight commands to GDB; they all
    have the <b>reverse-</b> prefix, and are more or less just the
    reverse version of the standard commands:
<p>
    <dl><dt><b>reverse-continue</b></dt><dd>Run in reverse until a breakpoint or watchpoint is hit, or to the
            point where Hindsight runs out of history.</dd><dt><b>reverse-next</b></dt><dd>Run in reverse and stop at the previous source code line.  Will
            skip subfunction calls.</dd><dt><b>reverse-nexti</b></dt><dd>Run in reverse and stop at the previous instruction.  Will skip
            subfunction calls.</dd><dt><b>reverse-step</b></dt><dd>Run in reverse and stop at the previous source code line.  Will
            enter subfunction calls.</dd><dt><b>reverse-stepi</b></dt><dd>Run in reverse and stop at the previous instruction.  Will enter 
            subfunction calls.</dd><dt><b>reverse-finish</b></dt><dd>Run in reverse till the point where the current function is
            called.</dd></dl>
<p>
    Normal break- and watchpoints set with <b>break</b> and <b>watch</b>
    will also be triggered when running in reverse using <b>reverse-continue</b>
<p>
    A small example of how to use <b>reverse-next</b>:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
22        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
(gdb) <b>p i</b>
$2 = 0
(gdb) <b>n</b>
24            c = foo (i) + c;
(gdb) <b>p i</b>
$3 = 1
(gdb) <b>reverse-next</b>
22        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
(gdb) <b>p i</b>
$4 = 0
</pre>
<p>
    The amount of history that Hindsight keeps is limited; it is only possibly
    to reverse back to the point where Hindsight was started.  If GDB recognizes
    that Hindsight has ran out of history, it will report an error.  Note that
    this is not a fatal error, and the debugging session can continue, without
    the possibility to reverse further than to the point where GDB reported the
    error.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
(gdb) reverse-continue 
Continuing.

No more history to reverse further.

    <a name="label393"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compiling GDB</h5 class="jdocu">


<a name="label394"></a>
<a name="label395"></a>
<p>
If you do not want to (or cannot) use one of the GDB executables in
<tt></tt><i>host</i><tt>/sys/bin/</tt>, you will most likely have to
compile GDB from source, even if your system already has GDB
installed. The reason for this is that a given GDB executable is
specialized both for the architecture of the computer you run it on
(host), and the architecture of the computer that runs the programs
you want to debug (target). Any GDB already installed on your computer
will have target identical to host, but this is often not what you
want when your target is a simulated machine.
<p>
The first step is to get the GDB source code. You can either get the
unmodified GDB from <a class="jdocu" href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/" target="_top">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/</a>, or a
Hindsight-aware GDB from <a class="jdocu" href="https://www.simics.net/pub/" target="_top">https://www.simics.net/pub/</a>. In
either case, the source will be packaged in a <tt>.tar.gz</tt>
file.
<p>
The second step is to make sure you have all the tools necessary to
compile GDB, such as GNU Make and a C compiler. On a Linux or Solaris
system, you probably have them already. On Windows, you will have to
install Cygwin; get it at <a class="jdocu" href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_top">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>.
<p>
That done, unpack and configure GDB like this:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
~&gt; <b>tar zxfv gdb-6.3.tar.gz</b>
~&gt; <b>cd gdb-6.3</b>
~/gdb-6.3&gt; <b>./configure --target=powerpc64-elf-linux</b>
</pre>
<p>
(On Windows, be sure to enter these commands in the <b>bash</b>
shell installed as part of Cygwin.)
<p>
The <b>--target</b> flag to <b>configure</b> specifies which
target architecture your new GDB binary will be specialized for (in
this example, a 64-bit PowerPC). These flags are tabulated in the
reference manual's section on <b>gdb-remote</b>, and will also
be printed on the Simics console when you run
<b>new-gdb-remote</b>.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
~/gdb-6.3&gt; <b>make</b>
</pre>
<p>
The build process takes a while; when done, it will have left a gdb
executable in the "gdb" subdirectory. You can execute it directly from
that location:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
~/gdb-6.3&gt; <b>./gdb/gdb</b>
</pre>
