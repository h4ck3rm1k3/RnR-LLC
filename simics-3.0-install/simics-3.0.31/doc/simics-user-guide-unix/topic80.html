<p>
In order to improve the speed of the simulation, Simics does not perform all
accesses through the memory spaces. The Simulator Translation Caches (STCs) try
to serve most memory operations directly by caching relevant information. In
particular, an STC is intended to contain the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The current logical-to-physical translation for the address;</li>
<li>A count of number of accesses to the address.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The general idea is that the STC will contain information about "harmless"
memory addresses, i.e., addresses where an access would not cause any device
state change or side-effect. A particular memory address is mapped by the STC
only if:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The given logical-to-physical mapping is valid.</li>
<li>An access would not affect the MMU (TLB) state.</li>
<li>There are no breakpoints, callbacks, etc associated with the address.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The contents of the STCs can be flushed at any time, so models using them to
improve speed can not rely on a specific address being cached. They can
however let the STCs cache addresses when further accesses to these addresses
do not change the state of the model (this is used by cache simulation with
<b>g-cache</b>; see chapter <a class="jdocu" href="topic86.html#label517">18</a>).
<p>
The STCs are activated by default. They can be turned on or off at the command
prompt, using the <b>stc-enable/disable</b> functions. An object connected
to the <tt>timing model</tt> interface can also mark a memory transaction
so that it won't be cached by the STCs. For example, the <b>trace</b> module uses
that method to ensure that no memory transaction will be cached, so that the
trace will be complete. 
<p>
Note that since transactions are inserted into the STCs when they are executed,
only objects connected to the <i>timing model</i> interface can influence
the STCs' behavior. The <em>Simics Programming Guide</em> provides a complete
description of the changes authorized on a memory transaction when using the
memory hierarchy interface.
