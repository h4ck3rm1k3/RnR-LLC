<p>
Simics is an <em><a name="label486">event</a> driven simulator</em> with a maximum
time resolution of a <em><a name="label487">clock cycle</a></em>. In a
single-processor system, the length (in seconds) of a clock <a name="label488">cycle</a> is
easily defined as 1 divided by the processor frequency set by the
user. As described later in this chapter, Simics can also handle
multiprocessor systems with different clock frequencies, but we will
focus on single-processor systems for the rest of this section.
<p>
As Simics makes the <a name="label489">simulated time</a> progress, cycle by cycle, events
are triggered and executed. Events include device interrupts, internal state
updates, as well as <em><a name="label490">step</a></em> executions. A <em>step</em> is the
unit in which Simics divides the execution of a flow of instructions going
through a processor; it is defined as the execution of an instruction, an
instruction resulting in an exception, or an interrupt. Steps are by far the
most common events.
<p>
Steps and cycles are fundamental Simics concepts. Simics exposes
two types of events to users: events linked to a specific step, and events
linked to a specific cycle. Step events are useful for debugging (execute 1
step at a time, stop after executing 3 steps, etc.), whereas time events are
rather independent from the flow of execution (sector read operation on the
hard disk will finish in 1 ms).
<p>
For each executed cycle, events are triggered in the following order:
<p>
<ol>
  <li>All events posted for this specific <i>cycle</i>, except step execution.
  </li>
  <li>For each step scheduled for execution on this cycle: 
    <ol>
      <li>All events scheduled for that specific <i>step</i>.</li>
      <li>A step execution.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Events belonging to the same category are executed in FIFO order: posted first
is executed first.
