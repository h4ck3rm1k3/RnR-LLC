<h4 class="jdocu">9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Link Object Timing</h4 class="jdocu">

<a name="label262"></a>

<p>
All frames that are sent over a link are delivered to the receiving
device/devices at a point in simulated time after the time when it was
sent.  The delay is the same for every frame, and is called the
<em><a name="label263">latency</a></em> of the link.  The latency is a
configuration parameter that can be set individually for each link
object.
<p>
Link objects are most often used to communicate between network
devices using separate clocks, and because of how Simics handles
simulated time, the clocks are not always completely synchronized.  To
avoid strange causality effects and indeterministic simulation, the
latency of any link must not be set so low that data sent over it
might reach the recipient at a point in time that it has already
passed.  This imposes a lower boundary on the latency, called the
<a name="label264">min-latency</a> of the link.  The value of the min-latency
depends on the simulation setup, in particular whether the simulation
is distributed between several Simics processes or not.  See Chapter <a class="jdocu" href="topic52.html#label340">11</a> for information about distributing the
simulation.
<p>
The latency of a link can be displayed by the
<b>&lt;ethernet-link&gt;.info</b> command:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>ethlink0.info</b>

================================================

                       Latency : 1 us
                  Distribution : local
                     Filtering : enabled

Devices:
                 Local devices : none
                Remote devices : none

                     Connected : No
</pre>
<p>
As can be seen from the example above, the default latency for an
Ethernet link object is one microsecond.
<p>
The latency of a link can be specified in the
<b>new-ethernet-link</b> command as a number of nanoseconds.  If
the latency of a link is set too low, it will be automatically
adjusted to the lowest value allowed by the setup. For example, if you
launch a new multi machine setup, such as <i>ebony-linux-multi</i>,
and try to create a link with too low latency, Simics will adjust the
latency automatically:
