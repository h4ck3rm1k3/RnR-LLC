<p>
Support for several processors talking to one cache is integrated in
<b>g-cache</b>. You just need to specify the list of CPUs connected to
the cache in the <i>cpus</i> attribute. Note that it is possible for the
cache to use the STCs as described above even with several processors.
<p>
You can use the sample MESI protocol to connect several caches in a
multiprocessor system. You need to provide the cache with a list of the other
caches snooping on the bus using the <i>snoopers</i> attribute. If you
have higher-level caches that are not snooping on the bus, you need to set the
<i>higher_level_caches</i> attribute so that invalidation is done
properly. Note that the sample MESI protocol was written to handle simple cases
such as several L1 write-through caches with L2 caches synchronizing via
MESI. To model more complex protocol, you will need to modify
<b>g-cache</b>.
<p>
If you use LRU replacement with several processors, you may have problems with
the way Simics schedules processor execution (read the chapter <a class="jdocu" href="topic82.html#label484">17</a> for more information). You may want to lower the CPU
switch time from its default value to prevent accesses "in the future" from
changing the way LRU replacement is behaving.
