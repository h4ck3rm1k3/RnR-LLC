    Requirements on memory and disk sizes depends on the workload, but at least
    512MB RAM and several GB of free disk is recommended. In general, it helps
    to have at least as much memory as what is being used on the simulated
    machine to avoid unnecessary swapping. A fast disk system speeds up loading
    and saving of disk images and checkpoints.
<p>
    If you are running Simics on a <a name="label53">laptop</a> and want to reduce the
    power consumption, you can try to use the
    <b><a name="label54">enable-real-time-mode</a></b> command to prevent Simics from
    simulating faster than real time (see the <em>Simics Reference
    Manual</em> for more information on this command). To further reduce the
    <a name="label55">CPU usage</a> of Simics, you can pass an argument to
    <b>enable-real-time-mode</b> that is less than 100 (in percent of real
    time).
