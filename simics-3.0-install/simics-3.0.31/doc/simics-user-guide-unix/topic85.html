<p>
Simics can model systems with several processors, each with their own clock
frequency. In this case the definition of how long a cycle is becomes
processor-dependent. Ideally, Simics would make time progress and execute one
cycle at a time, scheduling processors according to their frequency. However,
perfect synchronization is exceedingly slow, so Simics <em>serializes</em>
execution to improve performance.
<p>
Simics does this by dividing time into segments and serializing the execution
of separate processors within a segment. The length of these segments is
referred to as the <i>quantum</i> and is specified in seconds (this is similar
to the way operating systems implement multitasking on a single-processor
machine: each process is given access to the processor and runs for a certain
time quantum).  The processors are scheduled in a round-robin fashion, and when
a particular processor <em>P</em> has finished its quantum, all other processors
will finish their quanta before execution returns to <em>P</em>. The length of
the time quantum can be set by using the command
<b>cpu-switch-time</b>. The argument to <b>cpu-switch-time</b> is
specified in cycles (referring to the first processor in the system) rather
than absolute time.
<p>
As in the single-processor case, instruction execution and latency are defined
with execution modes and timing interfaces. Simics does not define the order in
which the processors are serialized, which means that if causality is to be
preserved, processor-to-processor communications must have a minimum latency of
one quantum. Another consequence of serializing the execution is that Simics
will maintain strict sequential consistency. However, through careful use of
the memory hierarchy interface, the user can choose to simulate other
consistency models.
<p>
As an example, consider a dual-processor system where the first processor runs
at <nobr>4 MHz</nobr> and the second at <nobr>1 MHz</nobr>. Setting
<b>cpu-switch-time</b> to 10 will give a quantum of
<nobr>2.5 simulated</nobr> microseconds. During each quantum, the first
processor will execute <nobr>10 steps</nobr>, and the second <nobr>2 or</nobr>
<nobr>3 steps</nobr>, not necessarily in that order. Breakpoints do not affect
this schedule, so that interaction remains non-intrusive.
<p>
Note that if you are single-stepping (<b>step-instruction</b>) on a
processor <em>P</em>, which has just executed the last cycle of a quantum, the
next single-step will cause all other processors to advance an entire quantum
and then <em>P</em> will stop after one step. This behavior makes it convenient
to follow the execution of instructions on a particular processor. You can use
the <b>&lt;processor&gt;.ptime</b> command to see the flow of time on each
particular processor in the simulated machine.
<p>
For a multi-processor simulation to run efficiently, the quantum should not be
set too low, since a CPU switch causes simulator overhead. It should not be set
below 10, and should preferably be set to 50 or higher. The default value is
1000. For a perfectly synchronized simulation, set the switch time to 1 (which
will give a very slow simulation but is useful for detailed cache studies, for
example). Note that all of the above remains essentially the same when running
a distributed simulation (see next section).
<p>
Time events in Simics are executed when the processor on which they were posted
run the triggering cycle during its quantum. However, it is possible to post
<em>synchronizing</em> time events that will ensure that all processors have
the same local time when the event is executed, independently of the time
quantum. Synchronizing events can not be posted less than one time quantum in
the future unless the simulation is already synchronized.
<p>
Simics MAI has limited support for multiprocessor simulation; processors are
always scheduled in a round-robin fashion, one cycle at a time.
<p>
Let us have a look at a 2-machines setup containing two SPARC SunFire machine
(with one processor each) to illustrate multiprocessor simulation. The
processor in the first machine runs at 168MHz; the other runs at 56MHz (equal
to 168/3). The time quantum (configured via the <b>cpu-switch-time</b>
command) is 1000 cycles of the first processor, or 6 microseconds.

<p>
While the first processor executed 10000 steps, the second processor completed
3333 steps, which corresponds to the ratio between the two frequencies (168MHz
compared to 56MHz). Let us now examine the effects of the time quantum:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>c 30</b>
[d1_cpu0] v:0xfffffffff0001364 p:0x1fff0001364  bne,pt %xcc, 0xfffffffff0001360

</pre>
<p>
Although the first processor ran 30 steps further, the second processor has not
run the 10 steps that we would expect, and the frequency ratio is not respected
anymore. This is the effect of the 1000 cycles time quantum: the first
processor is scheduled for the next 1000 cycles and no other processor will be
run until the quantum is finished. If we switch to the second processor and try
to make it run one step further, we will observe the following:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>pselect d2_cpu0</b>
simics&gt; <b>c 1</b>
[d2_cpu0] v:0xfffffffff0001364 p:0x1fff0001364  bne,pt %xcc, 0xfffffffff0001360

</pre>
<p>
The second processor has run 1 step further as requested, but the first had to
finish its time quantum before the second processor could be allowed to run,
which explains its step count of 11000 compared to 10030 before. Let us now set
the time quantum to 1:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>cpu-switch-time 1</b>
The switch time will change to 1 cycles (for CPU-0) once all<img src="nextline.png">
 processors have synchronized.

</pre>
<p>
Note that the new time quantum length will only become valid once all
processors have finished their current time quantum. This is why stepping one
more step forward with the second processor hasn't affected the first yet. Now
let us select the first processor again, and run three steps:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>pselect d1_cpu0</b>

simics&gt;
</pre>
<p>
All processors finished their 1000 cycles time quantum and started to run with
the new 1 cycle value, which means that they are now advancing in lockstep. For
every 3 steps performed by the first processor, the second executes 1.
