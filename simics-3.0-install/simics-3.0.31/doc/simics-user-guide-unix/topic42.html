<h4 class="jdocu">9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IP Services</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
It is often useful to be able to let the simulated machines use
services available on the simulated network, especially for boot-time
configuration.  Instead of adding a full system simulation of servers
running these services, a more efficient implementation is provided as
a Simics <em><a name="label266">service node</a></em>.
<p>
The <b><a name="label267">service-node</a></b> class provides a virtual
network node that acts as a server for a number of protocols, and it
can act as a IP router between networks.  The services supported are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>IP Based Routing</li>
<li>RARP</li>
<li>DHCP/BOOTP</li>
<li>DNS</li>
<li>Bootparam/Whoami RPC (simplified)</li>
<li>TFTP</li>
<li>Real network connections (see section <a class="jdocu" href="topic45.html#label293">10</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
There can be any number of <b>service-node</b> objects, and
each object can be connected to any number of Ethernet links.  In most
configurations, however, there will usually be a single service node
object.  The links themselves do not provide any services, so a
service node is needed to make the services available to target
machines connected to the link.
<p>
A service node can be created using the <b>new-service-node</b>
command:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>new-service-node</b>
Created service-node sn0
</pre>
<p>
This service node can then be connected to an Ethernet link object. For
example, if you already have an <b>ethernet-link</b> called
<b>ethlink0</b> and want the service-node to use the IP address 10.10.0.1
on it:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>sn0.connect ethlink0 10.10.0.1</b>
Connecting sn0 to ethlink0
Setting IP address of sn0 on network ethlink0 to 10.10.0.1
</pre>
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> The service node needs to have an <a name="label268">IP address</a> on each
link it is connected to.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
The link to attach the service node to can also be specified when creating the
service node.  This will make the default name given to the service reflect
which link object it is connected to. For example, if you already have an
<b>ethernet-link</b> called <b>ethlink0</b> and want the
service-node to use the IP address 10.10.0.1 on it:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>new-service-node link = ethlink0 ip = 10.10.0.1</b>
Created service-node ethlink0_sn0
Connecting ethlink0_sn0 to ethlink0
Setting IP address of ethlink0_sn0 on network ethlink0 to 10.10.0.1
</pre>
<p>
For each link that the service node connects to, a
<b>service-node-device</b> will be automatically created to
act as an Ethernet interface.  The name of these device objects are a
combination of the service node name and the link object name.
<p>
<a name="label269"></a><h5 class="jdocu">9.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IP Based Routing</h5 class="jdocu">

<a name="label270"></a>

<p>
A <b>service-node</b> object can provide IP based routing
between Ethernet links, allowing machines attached to different
networks to communicate with each other.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> To use the routing mechanisms, simulated machines must use the
<a name="label271">IP address</a> of the service node as a
<em><a name="label272"></a>gateway</em> for IP based
traffic. Configuring a gateway requires system administration skills,
and the exact procedure depends on the target operating system.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
The service node contains an internal IP routing table that is used
for packet routing between connected links.  The routing table can be
viewed using the <b>&lt;service-node&gt;.route</b> command:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>sn0.route</b>
Destination  Netmask        Gateway  Port
-----------------------------------------------------
10.10.0.0    255.255.255.0           sn0_ethlink0_dev
</pre>
<p>
The output is quite similar to <tt>route</tt> command available on
many systems. The <i>destination</i> and <i>netmask</i> fields specify
a target that can be either a network (i.e., a range of addresses) or
a single host (with netmask <tt>255.255.255.255</tt>). For packets
with this target as their destination, the <i>port</i> field specifies
the service node network device on which link the packet should be
sent.
<p>
New entries can be added to the routing table with the <b>&lt;service-node&gt;.route-add</b> command. If you have a
<b>service-node</b> called <b>sn0</b> connected to two links called
<b>ethlink0</b> and <b>ethlink1</b>, you could, for example, set up
routes like this:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>sn0.route-add 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0 link = ethlink0</b>
simics&gt; <b>sn0.route-add 192.168.1.0/26 link = ethlink1</b>
simics&gt; <b>sn0.route-add 10.10.0.0 255.255.0.0 192.168.0.1 ethlink0</b>
simics&gt; <b>sn0.route-add 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 192.168.1.1 ethlink1</b>
simics&gt; <b>sn0.route</b>
Destination  Netmask          Gateway      Port
-----------------------------------------------------------
192.168.0.0  255.255.255.0                 sn0_ethlink0_dev
192.168.1.0  255.255.255.192               sn0_ethlink1_dev
10.10.0.0    255.255.0.0      192.168.0.1  sn0_ethlink0_dev
default                       192.168.1.1  sn0_ethlink1_dev
</pre>
<p>
The destination address and the netmask identify the target, and
should be given as strings in dotted decimal form. If the target is a
single host, the netmask should be given as
<tt>"255.255.255.255"</tt>.
<p>
<a name="label273"></a><h5 class="jdocu">9.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DHCP and BOOTP</h5 class="jdocu">

<a name="label274"></a>
<a name="label275"></a>

<p>
A service node can act as a
<i><a name="label276">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</a></i>
(<a name="label277">DHCP</a>) or <i><a name="label278">Bootstrap Protocol</a></i>
(<a name="label279">BOOTP</a>) server,
 responding to requests from clients that can read their
network configuration from such a server.  The DHCP protocol is an
extension of the BOOTP protocol, and for many uses the feature set
used are more or less the same.  The Simics implementation uses the
same configuration for both services.
<p>
The service node has a table that maps <a name="label280">MAC addresses</a> to <a name="label281">IP
addresses</a> and domain name.  This is used to answer DHCP or BOOTP
request.  An entry to this table can be added with the <b>&lt;service-node&gt;.add-host</b> command:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>sn0.add-host 10.10.0.1 node1 mac="10:10:10:10:10:01"</b>
Adding host info for IP 10.10.0.1: node1.network.sim  MAC: 10:10:10:10:10:01
</pre>
<p>
The current contents of the table can be viewed with the <b>&lt;service-node&gt;.list-host-info</b> command:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>sn0.list-host-info</b>
IP         name.domain        MAC
-----------------------------------------------
10.10.0.1  node1.network.sim  10:10:10:10:10:01
</pre>
<p>
A pool of IP addresses for dynamic DHCP leases can be added with the
<b>&lt;service-node&gt;.dhcp-add-pool</b> command.  This is used
for dynamically assigning IP addresses to new clients.  When an entry
from the pool is used, the new mapping is stored in the internal
host info table, including an automatically generated name that can be
found through DNS queries.
<p>
If a DHCP client's MAC address matches an entry in the table, it is assigned
the corresponding IP address. If there is no matching MAC address, the dynamic
address pools will be searched for an available IP address.
<p>
The DHCP implementation in <b>service-node</b> is simple, and might not
work with all DHCP clients.
<p>
<a name="label282"></a><h5 class="jdocu">9.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DNS</h5 class="jdocu">

<a name="label283"></a>

<p>
The service node includes the functionality of a simple <i>Domain Name
Server</i> (DNS), that a simulated client can use to translate a
host/domain name into an IP address and vice versa. The DNS service is
based on the same host table as the DHCP service, and only answers
requests for A and PTR records.
<p>
For entries in the table that will only be used for DNS requests, and
not for assigning IP address by means of DHCP, the MAC address can be
left out.  The <b>&lt;service-node&gt;.add-host</b> command can be
used to add table entries, and the <b>&lt;service-node&gt;.list-host-info</b> command prints the current
table.  By default, all host entries will use the <tt>network.sim</tt>
domain.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>sn0.add-host 10.10.0.1 donut</b>
Adding host info for IP 10.10.0.1: donut.network.sim
simics&gt; <b>sn0.add-host 10.11.0.1 foo other.domain</b>
Adding host info for IP 10.11.0.1: foo.other.domain
simics&gt; <b>sn0.list-host-info</b>
IP         name.domain        MAC | IP         name.domain        MAC
----------------------------------+----------------------------------
10.10.0.1  donut.network.sim      | 10.11.0.1  foo.other.domain
</pre>
<p>
For dynamically added DHCP addresses, a DNS name will be added for the
new IP number, so that any address handed out by a DHCP server can be
found by the DNS service.
<p>
When connected to a real network, the DNS service can do external lookups for
names it does not recognize.
<p>
<a name="label284"></a><h5 class="jdocu">9.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TFTP</h5 class="jdocu">

<a name="label285"></a>

<p>
The service node also supports the <i>Trivial File Transfer
Protocol</i> (<a name="label286">TFTP</a>, see <em>RFC 1350</em>) and can be
used to transfer files between the host system (running the
simulation) and a simulated (target) client. The TFTP functionality is
often used in network booting, together with the BOOTP facilities, to
load OS kernels and images, and can also be used interactively from
the <tt>tftp</tt> command found on many systems.
<p>
Files that should be transferred from the host system to the simulated
client should be located in a directory on the Simics path.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> This is the same path as used by image objects and can be viewed
with <b>list-directory</b> command and modified with the
<b>add-directory</b> command.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
Files transferred from the simulated client to the host, will also end
up in the same directory.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> TFTP is based on UDP, and each package is acknowledged
individually before the transfer is allowed to continue. Depending on
the latency of the link, the transfer of large files can be slow. In
that case, ensuring that the link can use a lower latency will
increase performance.<hr class="jdocu_note">
