<h4 class="jdocu">17.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instruction Execution Timing</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
<a name="label492"></a><h5 class="jdocu">Simics in-order</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
In the default model, the execution of a step takes no time by itself,
and steps are run in program order. This is called the Simics
<em><a name="label493">in-order</a></em> model. It implements the basic instruction set
abstraction that instructions execute discretely and sequentially.
This minimalistic approach makes simulation fast but does not attempt
to model <a name="label494">execution timing</a> in any way.
<p>
Normally one step is executed every cycle, so that the step and cycle
counts are the same. See the section <b>Changing the Step Rate</b> for
how to change this.
<p>

<a name="label495"></a><h5 class="jdocu">Stalling</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
The in-order model can be extended by adding <em><a name="label496">timing
models</a></em> to control the timing of memory operations,
typically using the memory hierarchy interface described in chapter
<a class="jdocu" href="topic76.html#label477">16</a>. When timing models are introduced,
steps are no longer atomic operations taking no time. A step
performing a memory operation (whether an instruction fetch or a data
transaction) can <a name="label497">stall</a> for a number of cycles. Cycle events
are performed during the <a name="label498">stalling period</a> as time goes
forward. Step events are performed just before the step execution, as
in the default model. Note that in this mode, Simics still executes
one step at a time, with varying timing for each step, so the
simulation is still performing an in-order execution of the
instruction flow. The basic step rate can also be changed; see the section
<b>Changing the Step Rate</b> below.
<p>

<a name="label499"></a><h5 class="jdocu">Simics MAI</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
Simics also has an extended timing control mode called <em>Micro-architectural
Interface</em> (MAI). When running in MAI mode, step execution is completely
under user control. Cycle events are still executed one cycle at a time, but no
step execution is performed unless a user <em>processor timing model</em> is
driving it. This user timing model is usually called every cycle to make
instructions advance in the processor pipeline, stall, allocate resources,
etc. Whenever an instruction is committed by the processor timing model, Simics
increases the step counter, executes all step events related to this step and
finally commits the step execution. From the point of view of event handling,
Simics MAI is similar to the standard model, but the number of steps executed
(or, in this case, committed) per cycle is entirely under user control.
<p>
Simics MAI transcends the standard model by providing an infrastructure for
parallelized and speculative execution, allowing a much more accurate timing
simulation of complex processors. Simics MAI mode is also called Simics
<em>out-of-order</em> mode. A complete description of Simics MAI is available
in the <em>Simics Micro-Architectural Interface</em> document. Note that
Simics MAI is only available for the UltraSPARC and x86/x86-64 processor
models.

<a name="label500"></a><h5 class="jdocu">Choosing an Execution Mode</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
Choosing an execution mode is matter of trade-off between performance and
accuracy. As the timing control becomes more refined, the simulation slows
down. Simics allows you to choose the execution mode dynamically (using
checkpoints), so it is possible to use a simple model to reach interesting
parts of the simulation quickly, then switch to a more complex model.
<p>

<a name="label501"></a><h5 class="jdocu">Changing the Step Rate</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
The <em><a name="label502">step rate</a></em> is the number of steps executed each
cycle, disregarding any stalling. It is expressed as the quotient
q/p. By default, p=q=1; this
schedules one step to run in each cycle. This can be changed by
setting the <i>step_rate</i> processor attribute to
[q, p, r] where the last
r parameter is a remainder to keep track of the relative
phase of the cycle and step counters; set it to zero if you are not
interested in sub-cycle accuracy. For example,
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
@conf.cpu0.step_rate = [3, 4, 0]
</pre>
<p>
will set the step rate of <b>cpu0</b> to 3/4; that is, three steps
every four cycles.
<p>
If q&lt;p, then some cycles will execute no step at all; if
q&gt;p, then some cycles will execute more than one step.  The step
rate parameters are currently limited to 1 &lt;= p &lt;= 128 with
p=2<sup>k</sup> for some integer k, and 1 &lt;= q &lt;=
128.
<p>
Setting a non-unity step rate can be used to better approximate the
timing of a target machine averaging more or less than one instruction
per cycle. It can also be used to compensate for Simics running
instructions slower than actual hardware when it is desirable to have
the simulated time match real time; specifying a lower step rate will
cause simulated time go faster.
<p>
The step rate is sometimes called <a name="label503">IPC</a> (instructions per
cycle), and its inverse, the <em><a name="label504">cycle rate</a></em>, may be
called <a name="label505">CPI</a> (cycles per instruction). The actual rates will
depend on how many extra cycles are added by stalling.
<p>
Let us look at an example using a single Ebony card. We will first run 1
million steps with the default settings:

The processor has run 1 million steps, taking 1 million cycles to execute
them. Let us set the cycle rate to the value mentioned above, 3 steps for every
4 cycles:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">

<p>
When running the next 1.2 million cycles, the processor executes only 900000
steps, which corresponds to the 3/4 rate that we configured.
<p>

<a name="label506"></a><h5 class="jdocu">Suspending Time or Execution</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
<a name="label507"></a>
It is possible to set the <a name="label508">step rate</a> to infinity, or equivalently, to
suspend <a name="label509">simulated time</a> while executing steps. This is done by
setting the <i>step_per_cycle_mode</i> processor attribute to one of the
following values:
<p>
<dl><dt><b><tt>"constant"</tt></b></dt><dd>Steps are executed at the constant and finite rate specified in
     the <i>step_rate</i> attribute</dd><dt><b><tt>"infinite"</tt></b></dt><dd>Steps are executed with no progress in simulated time</dd></dl>
<p>
While time is suspended, the cycle counter does not advance, nor are
any time events run. To the simulated machine this appears as if all
instructions are run infinitely fast.
<p>
<a name="label510"></a>
<a name="label511"></a><a name="label512"></a>
<a name="label513"></a><a name="label514"></a>
Conversely, it is possible set the step rate to zero, thus suspending
execution while letting simulated time pass. This can be done by
<a name="label515">stalling</a> the processor for a finite time (see
<b>Stalling</b> above) or by <em>disabling</em>
the processor for an indefinite time. Disabling and re-enabling
processors is done with the commands <b>&lt;processor&gt;.enable</b>
and <b>&lt;processor&gt;.disable</b>.
<p>
Using the same example as above, we set the step per cycle mode to "infinite"
to prevent the simulated time from advancing:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>@conf.cpu0.step_per_cycle_mode = "infinite"</b>
simics&gt; <b>c 1000000</b>
[cpu0] v:0xfff8a614 p:0x1fff8a614  cmpw r3,r5
simics&gt; <b>ptime</b>
processor                 steps             cycles    time [s]
cpu0                    1000000                  0       0.000
simics&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The processor has executed 1 million steps but the simulated time has not
advanced. Note that setting this mode would probably prevent a machine like
Ebony from booting since many hardware events (like interrupts) are time-based.
