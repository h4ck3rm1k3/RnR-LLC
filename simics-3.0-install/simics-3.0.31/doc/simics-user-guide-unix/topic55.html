<p>
To create a central server object in a Simics instance, the
<b>new-central-server</b> can be used:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>new-central-server</b>
[central_server info] Listening to port 1909
[central_server info] Listening to unix socket /tmp/simics-central.<i>user</i>
Created central_server
</pre>
<p>
Without arguments, this command will listen for TCP connections on the
standard port (1909), and on the standard file socket name.
This can be changed by specifying on the command line where it should
listen for connections. 
<p>
The minimum <a name="label348">latency</a> is by default set to 10 milliseconds,
but this can also be changed when creating the central server object.
It is not possible to change the minimum latency after the server is
created.
<p>
Creating a central server like this does not automatically make the
Simics instance in which the server runs part of the distributed
simulation.  If any simulation is to be done in the Simics instance
acting as a central server, a central client is required in the same
Simics, and can be added with the <b>connect-central</b> command:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>connect-central obj=central_server</b>
Created central_client
[central_server info] New connection with id 0
Connected to Simics Central
</pre>
<p>
Other Simics instances can be connected using TCP connections.  This
works both for instances on the same host or over the host network:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>connect-central <i>hostname</i></b>
Created central_client
[central_client info] Connected to server
Connected to Simics Central
</pre>
<p>
When running a client Simics on the same host as the server, it is
better to use file sockets.  This can be done by specifying the socket
file name to the <b>connect-central</b>, but if the server uses
the default socket file name, and runs as the same user as the client,
it is simpler to specify <tt>localhost</tt> as the server.  This will
automatically be changed to a file socket if the socket is found,
otherwise a TCP connection to local host is tried.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>connect-central localhost</b>
Created central_client
[central_client info] Connected to server
Connected to Simics Central
simics&gt; <b>central_client.info</b>
Information about central_client [class central-client]
=======================================================

                Identification : <i>a string</i>
                        Server : /tmp/simics-central.<i>user</i>
</pre>
<p>
Another way to specify that a Simics instance should connect to a
Central server is to use the <tt>-central</tt> flag to start Simics.
This makes it very simple to use the same Simics script without
modification even when running with different servers.
