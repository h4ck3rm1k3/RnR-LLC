<p>
The simulation of systems connected over an Ethernet network can be
distributed over several Simics instances in a distributed simulation,
as described in Chapter <a class="jdocu" href="topic52.html#label340">11</a>.  A link object
can be configured to have global distribution, which means that
several link object in separate Simics instances can form a shared
link, over which all connected systems can communicate even if they
are simulated by different Simics instances.
<p>
A link object with global distribution is automatically joined with
any other link object in another Simics instance if it also has global
distribution and has the same name.
<p>
The way to make a link object have global distribution is to set its
<em>central</em> attribute to point to the
<b>central-client</b> object.  The <b>&lt;ethernet-link&gt;.info</b> shows the current setting.
(Note that you must set up a central server and client as 
described in Chapter <a class="jdocu" href="topic52.html#label340">11</a> for
these examples to work.)
