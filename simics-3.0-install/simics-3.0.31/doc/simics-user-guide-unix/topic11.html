<h4 class="jdocu">3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simics Compatibility</h4 class="jdocu">

    
<p>
    In general, Simics strives for compatibility between major
    releases. However, different parts of Simics will provide different level
    of compatibility.
<p>
    The following interfaces are backward compatible between major
    releases. Any exceptions is listed in the release notes: 
<p>
    <ul>
       <li>Configurations and checkpoints</li>
       <li>Simics API</li>
       <li>CLI commands</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    The following parts may change in major release and warnings may
    not be listed in the release notes: 
<p>
    <ul>
       <li>Simics file structure</li>
       <li>Simics library source code</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    The following parts are likely to change in major release without
    any warning: 
<p>
    <ul>
       <li>Configuration scripts</li>
       <li>Module source code</li>
       <li>Example code</li>
       <li>Simics ABI</li>
    </ul> 
<p>
    Platform support may change at a major release. 
<p>
    &nbsp;
<p>
    For minor releases, the Simics ABI is backward compatible with rare
    exceptions due to error corrections. Error corrections causing
    incompatibility are noted in the release notes while backward compatible
    ABI extensions are not guaranteed to be mentioned. Thus, device models will
    usually only have to be re-compiled for a new major release and it should
    be possible to load them directly into a newer minor release. Note that
    there may be direct dependencies between modules unrelated to the Simics
    ABI that force two or more modules to be updated simultaneously.
<p>
    Processor models are not guaranteed to be be movable even between minor
    releases. Instead a new version of the processor module is supplied with
    each new minor release.
<p>
    Communication between Simics simulation processes is only guaranteed to
    work when running the same version of Simics.
<p>
    DML code has a version number which is recognized or rejected by the DML
    compiler. DMLC generates code for the Simics version it is distributed
    with. However, the user can write DML code that runs with an older minor
    version of Simics by avoiding using interfaces introduced in later minor
    versions.
<p>
    Target model functionality may have been be extended and corrected between
    minor releases. Target timing may have been changed between minor
    releases. Important updates and changes will be noted in the release notes.
