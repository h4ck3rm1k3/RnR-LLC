<h4 class="jdocu">4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debugging</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Some steps in this section require Hindsight.
However, you will grasp the basic debugging commands even if Hindsight is
not available.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
This section demonstrates some source-level debugging facilities that
Simics provides.
<p>
Your Simics distribution contains an
example code snippet called <tt>debug_example.c</tt>.
<p>
Copy the source file and corresponding compiled executable into your
workspace using the following commands.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>!cp [simics]/targets/ebony/debug_example.c .</b>
simics&gt;  <b>!cp [simics]/targets/ebony/images/debug_example .</b>
simics&gt;  <b>c</b>
</pre>
<p>
Replace <tt>[simics]</tt> with the Simics installation directory.
<p>

We recommend opening the file <tt>debug_example.c</tt> in an
editor of your choice to easier follow the debugging example.
This file contains the code that we are going to debug.
The program is supposed to print some information about
the users on a system.
<p>
In the previous section we copied the executable into the simulated
system by using <i>SimicsFS</i>.
Now, run that program by starting it in the simulated terminal.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
root@firststeps: ~# <b>./debug_example</b>
[...]
Got segmentation fault!
root@firststeps: ~#
</pre>
<p>
This output indicates that our program crashed.
Let us use Simics features to debug it.
<p>
Simics needs to know the mapping between addresses and line numbers,
and this information is stored in the executable. The
<b>symtable</b>
module in Simics contains commands related to symbolic debugging.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
<b>[press control-C]</b>
simics&gt;  <b>new-symtable file = debug_example</b>
Created symbol table 'debug_example'
ABI for debug_example is ppc-elf-32
debug_example set for context primary_context
simics&gt; </pre>
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Remember to write <tt><b>file =</b></tt>, otherwise you will
create an empty <b>symtable</b> named <tt>debug_example</tt>.
You can add files to an existing <b>symtable</b> with the
<b>&lt;symtable&gt;.load-symbols</b> command.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
Since the <tt>debug_example</tt> was not compiled on your machine, Simics will 
not be able to find the source code without a little help:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>debug_example.source-path "/tmp&gt;."</b>
</pre>
The command above basically says: whenever the path <tt>/tmp</tt> is found in
the debug information of the binary, replace it with the path to source file 
(in this case the current working directory, the "."). 
You can get more information on the <b>&lt;symtable&gt;.source-path</b> 
command using <b>help</b>:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>help symtable.source-path</b>
</pre>
<p>
To help debugging your programs, we have introduced
<i><a name="label79">magic instruction</a>s</i>. These are instructions
that have no side-effects on a real machine, but can be programmed
to do things when run inside Simics, for example stop the simulation.
<p>
The debug example code contains such an instruction in the
beginning of the <tt>main</tt> function. Enable break on magic
instruction by the command <b>magic-break-enable</b>:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>magic-break-enable</b>
simics&gt;  <b>c</b>
</pre>
<p>
Now rerun <tt>debug_example</tt>:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
root@firststeps: ~# <b>./debug_example</b>
</pre>
<p>
Simics will stop at the magic instruction and show the corresponding
source code line and assembly opcode.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
[cpu0] v:0x10000634 p:0x00737b634  magic instruction (or r0,r0,r0)
main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffe34) at /tmp/debug_example.c:73
73              MAGIC_BREAKPOINT;
simics&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, this magic instruction is effectively a no-operation,
which means that the simulation will run as usual on real hardware, or when
magic breakpoints are disabled in Simics.
<p>
Now let us find the cause of the segmentation fault. Place a breakpoint
in the <b><i>sigsegv_handler()</i></b> function.
The <b><i>sigsegv_handler()</i></b> function is
called when the program receives the segmentation fault and will allow the
program to gracefully exit.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>break (sym sigsegv_handler)</b>
Breakpoint 1 set on address 0x10000520 with access mode 'x'
1
simics&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
Resume the simulation. It will stop at the signal handler, and by giving
the <b>stack-trace</b> command,
you can also see the chain of function calls leading up to this point.
This list gives you useful hints about where the crash occurred.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>c</b>
Code breakpoint 1 reached.
[cpu0] v:0x10000520 p:0x00737b520  stwu r1,-32(r1)
sigsegv_handler (sig=0) at /tmp/debug_example.c:35
35      {
simics&gt;  <b>stack-trace</b>
#0 0x10000520 in sigsegv_handler (sig=0) at /tmp/debug_example.c:35
#1 0x7ffff3d8 in ?? ()
#2 0xff06a44 in ?? ()
#3 0xff0ff60 in ?? ()
#4 0x100006ac in main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffe34) at /tmp/debug_example.c:82
#5 0xfed5fdc in ?? ()
#6 0x0 in ?? ()
simics&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
Simics prints question marks when no symbol could be found at the
address. This can either be a bogus address or a function inside the
standard library, to which no symbols have been loaded.
<p>
A few frames down you have the <b><i>main()</i></b> function, which caused the
crash. Now we run the simulation backward into that function.
<b>reverse-step-line</b> will run backwards until the previous
known source line is reached.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>reverse-step-line</b>

[cpu0] v:0x100006a8 p:0x00737b6a8  bl 0x10010c54
main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffe34) at /tmp/debug_example.c:82
82                      printf("Type: %s\n", user.type);
simics&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
This line cause the crash. Let us examine what <tt>user.type</tt> contains:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>psym user.type</b>
(char *) 0xa94 (unreadable)
simics&gt;  <b>psym user</b>
{name = 0x7ffffdc0 "shutdown", type = (char *) 0xa94 (unreadable)}
simics&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
As you can see,
the <tt>type</tt> member points to an unreadable
address, which caused the crash. Where does this pointer come from?
What we want to do is to find where the last write to this pointer
occurred.
<p>
Using Hindsight, we can first set a write-access breakpoint on the
memory of interest, and run backward (using <b>reverse</b>)
until the breakpoint is reached.
After some time will find the place where the write takes place.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>break -w (sym "&amp;user.type") (sym "sizeof user.type")</b>
Breakpoint 2 set on address 0x7ffffdc8, length 4 with access mode 'w'
2
simics&gt;  <b>reverse</b>
Breakpoint on write to address 0x7ffffdc8 in primary_context.
Completing instruction @ 0xff365e0 on cpu0.
[cpu0] v:0x0ff365e4 p:0x0075275e4  beqlr
simics&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
Now, examine the stack trace:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>stack-trace</b>
#0 0xff365e4 in ?? ()
#1 0x100005d8 in read_developer (p=0x7ffffdc0, f=0x10010ca0)
    at /tmp/debug_example.c:60
#2 0x10000674 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffe34) at /tmp/debug_example.c:80
#3 0xfed5fdc in ?? ()
#4 0x0 in ?? ()
simics&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
In the stack trace, you will see that a call from <tt>read_developer()</tt>
have caused the crash.
Switch to that frame and display the code being run.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>frame 1</b>
#1 0x100005d8 in read_developer (p=0x7ffffdc0, f=0x10010ca0)
    at /tmp/debug_example.c:60
simics&gt;  <b>list read_developer 15</b>
 48   {
 49           char line[100], *colon;
 50
 51           if (fgets(line, 100, f) == NULL)
 52                   return 0;       /* end of file */
 53
 54           /* Type is always developer */
 55           p-&gt;type = "developer";
 56
 57           /* Everything until the first colon is the name */
 58           colon = strchr(line, ':');
 59           *colon = '\0';
 60           strcpy(p-&gt;name, line);
 61           return 1;
 62   }
simics&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
On line 60 you can see that while the <i>name</i> field was filled in
using <tt>strcpy</tt>,
our failing pointer was accidentally overwritten (remember that the breakpoint
was placed on the <i>type</i> member). If you write
<tt><b>psym line</b></tt> you will see that the string
copied is <tt>"shutdown"</tt>. A look into the declaration of
<tt>struct person</tt> shows that the <i>name</i> field is
only <nobr>8 bytes</nobr> big, and hence has no space for the trailing
null byte.
<p>
Check the contents of <tt>p</tt> after and before the 
actual write to verify it is overwritten.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>psym "*p"</b>
{name = 0x7ffffdc0 "shutdown", type = (char *) 0xa94 (unreadable)}
simics&gt;  <b>reverse-step-instruction</b>

{name = 0x7ffffdc0 "shutdown\020", type = (char *) 0x10000a94 "developer"}
simics&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
To clean up after our debug session, we must remove the breakpoints
that we have set. They are identified with a number and can be shown
using <b>list-breakpoints</b>.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>delete 1</b>
simics&gt;  <b>delete 2</b>
