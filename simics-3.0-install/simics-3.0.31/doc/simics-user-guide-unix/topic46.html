<h4 class="jdocu">10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accessing Host Ethernet Interfaces</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
When connecting to a real network using other connection types than port
forwarding, Simics needs low-level access to the simulation host's Ethernet
interfaces to send and receive packets. However, operating systems do not
usually allow user programs low-level access to Ethernet interfaces. You
therefore have to configure the simulation host to allow Simics low-level
access.
<p>

This can be done in two ways. You can give administrative privileges
to a small helper program called <tt><a name="label297">openif</a></tt>, which
will access the simulation host's Ethernet interface for Simics. This
is called <em>raw</em> access in Simics. Or, you can create a virtual
Ethernet (<a name="label298">TAP</a><a name="label299"></a>) interface that Simics
can access with user privileges. This is called <em>TAP</em> access in
Simics.
<p>


Different connection types can use different access types. Ethernet bridging
connections can use either raw or TAP access, IP routing connections can only
use raw access, and host connections can only use TAP access.
<p>
To tell Simics to use raw or TAP access when creating an Ethernet bridging
connection, specify <i>raw</i> or <i>tap</i> as the <i>host-access</i>
argument to <b>connect-real-network-bridge</b>.
<p>
<a name="label300"></a><h5 class="jdocu">10.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raw Access</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
With raw access, Simics uses a small helper program, <tt>openif</tt>, to access
the simulation host's Ethernet interfaces. <tt>openif</tt> is launched from
Simics and executes with administrative privileges. This way you do not need
administrative privileges to connect Simics to the real network once
<tt>openif</tt> has been installed. <em>Simics Installation Guide</em>
contains instructions for installing <tt>openif</tt>.
<p>
If <tt>openif</tt> is not installed in its default location, you can use the
command <b>network-helper</b> to tell Simics where to find it. This command
needs to be issued before connecting to the real network, for example:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>network-helper /usr/local/sbin/openif</b>
</pre>
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> If <tt>openif</tt> is not installed so that it will run with
administrative privileges, the connection to the real network will fail.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
Usually, an Ethernet interface only receives packets addressed to the host
itself, and ignores other packets. However, when you use Ethernet bridging
without MAC address translation and raw access, the interface also needs to
receive packets addressed to the simulated machines. This can be achieved be
enabling promiscuous mode on the interface. On Linux, this is done by
specifying the <tt>promisc</tt> argument to <tt>ifconfig</tt>, which requires
administrative privileges. For example, if you want to use the <tt>eth0</tt>
interface:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
computer# <b>ifconfig eth0 promisc</b>
</pre>
<p>
Enabling promiscuous mode on an interface means that the operating system will
have to process all incoming packets. On a network with a lot of traffic, this
may therefore cause a performance degradation on the simulation host. To
disable promiscuous mode when it is no longer needed, use the <tt>-promisc</tt>
argument to <tt>ifconfig</tt>:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
computer# <b>ifconfig eth0 -promisc</b>
</pre>
<p>

<a name="label301"></a><h5 class="jdocu">10.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAP Access</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> TAP access is not supported on Solaris host.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
With TAP access Simics will connect the simulated network to a virtual Ethernet
(TAP) interface provided by the operating system. Accessing the TAP interface
does not require administrative privileges, so once the TAP interface has been
configured you can connect Simics to the real network without administrative
privileges.
<p>
The TAP interface can either be bridged to a real Ethernet interface to create
an Ethernet bridging connection, or configured with an IP address to create a
host connection. Either way, creating a TAP interface that Simics can use is
done in two simple steps. These commands require administrative privileges:
<p>
<ol>
<p>
    <li>Give the user running the simulation access to the
    <tt>/dev/net/tun</tt> device.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
computer# <b>chmod 666 /dev/net/tun</b>
</pre></li>
<p>
   <li>Create the TAP interface. Here the name of the user that will be using
   the TAP interface is assumed to be <tt>joe</tt> and the name of the TAP
   interface will be <tt>sim_tap0</tt>, but you should of course replace them
   with the correct user name and the name of the TAP interface that you want.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
computer# <b><a name="label302">tunctl</a> -u joe -t sim_tap0</b>
Set 'sim_tap0' persistent and owned by uid 4711
</pre></li>
<p>
</ol>
<p>
To remove a TAP interface when you are done with it, use the <tt>-d</tt>
argument to <tt>tunctl</tt>. Again, this requires administrative privileges:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
computer# <b>tunctl -d sim_tap0</b>
Set 'sim_tap0' nonpersistent
</pre>
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> The <tt><a name="label303">tunctl</a></tt> utility is usually not present in
default Linux installations, so you may therefore have to install it
yourself.  It is usually included in the User Mode Linux package. For
convenience, a pre-built version is included in
<tt>[simics]/</tt><em>hosttype</em><tt>/sys/bin/</tt> (replace
<tt></tt><em>hosttype</em><tt></tt> with <tt>x86-linux</tt> or
<tt>amd64-linux</tt> depending on your host type).<hr class="jdocu_note">
