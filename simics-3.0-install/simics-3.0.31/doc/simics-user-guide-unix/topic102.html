<p>
Since memory-spaces can be mapped in other memory-spaces, it is possible to
create loops where accesses never reach any target device. One typical case
is a PCI memory-space with bridges that has both downstream and upstream
mappings. In a real system, the bridge typically doesn't snoop its own
transactions and there will be no loop. But in Simics there are usually n
bridge devices mapped between different memory-spaces. Instead the bridge
will create space-to-space mappings. To avoid loops in this case, bridges
should be careful when setting up memory-space mappings. Simics will make
sure that an access does not loop by terminating it after 512 memory-space
transitions. If this limit is reached, it is considered a configuration error
and Simics will stop.
