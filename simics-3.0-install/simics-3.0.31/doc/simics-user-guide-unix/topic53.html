<h4 class="jdocu">11.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synchronization</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
Ideally, the parallel simulation processes should be completely
synchronized, so that anything that happens simultaneously in
simulated time also happens simultaneously in real time.  This would
allow events triggered in one process to almost immediately have a
deterministic effect in another process.
<p>
Unfortunately, this is not realistic.  The amount of overhead to keep
the processes synchronized would be overwhelming, leaving little time to
do real work.  Furthermore, the speed of the simulation varies over
time, so that the second 1000 cycles of simulated time may take longer
or shorter time to simulate than the first 1000 cycles etc.  If all
simulation processes were executed in lock-step synchronization, it
would mean that most processes would constantly be waiting for the one
that was currently slowest.
<p>
The remedy for this is to allow the processes some slack.  The
distributed simulation is not kept completely synchronized, but there
is an upper bound placed on the allowed difference in time.  If one
process is simulating at a certain point in simulated time, all other
processes must be kept at a point in simulated time that is close
enough to that process.
<p>
To put it more mathematically, the absolute difference
|T<i>n</i> &minus; T<i>m</i>| is always less
than or equal to the maximum slack D for any two processes
<i>n</i> and <i>m</i>.
<p>
The effect of this is that any event in the simulation can not have
any deterministic effect in a simulation process other than the one
triggering it, unless the effect happens long enough in simulated time
after the event that triggered it.  The delay that must pass is the
same as the maximum slack allowed by the synchronization protocol, and
the reason is that the other process may already be that much ahead in
simulated time, so it is impossible to make the event have any effect
any sooner.
<p>
The maximum slack thus defines the <em><a name="label342">minimum
latency</a><a name="label343"></a></em> for inter-process communication.
