<h4 class="jdocu">22.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Command Overview</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
Hindsight&trade; is the technology utilized by Simics to achieve reverse execution.
<p>
Before any reverse operations can be performed, at least one time bookmark
must be added. Depending upon how Simics is invoked (and various user
preferences), a time bookmark denoted "start" is sometimes added
automatically at the beginning of the simulation. Reverse operations are
possible in the region following the first (i.e. oldest) bookmark. Bookmarks can
be managed through the commands
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>set-bookmark label</b>
    simics&gt; <b>list-bookmarks</b>
    simics&gt; <b>delete-bookmark [label | -all]</b>.
</pre>
<p>
The main reverse execution commands are
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>reverse</b>
    simics&gt; <b>reverse-to position</b>
    simics&gt; <b>skip-to position</b>.
</pre>
The <b>reverse</b> and <b>reverse-to</b> commands run the simulation backwards
until a breakpoint occurs or till the oldest time bookmark is reached. Skipping is somewhat
similar to reversing; the main difference is that
intermediate breakpoints are ignored. Skipping can also be much faster
than reversing.
<p>
The <b>skip-to</b> and <b>reverse-to</b>
commands take either an absolute step count or a time bookmark
as argument.
<p>
Many forward executing commands used for debugging has
a corresponding reverse variant obtained by adding a reverse prefix.
The reverse variant of <b>step-instruction</b> is for instance
<b>reverse-step-instruction</b>.
<p>
Any external input (like a human typing on a virtual serial console) is
replayed when the simulation is being run forward after a reversal; this
guarantees that the simulation will follow the same path as originally.
For the same reason, all external input is ignored until the point is reached
where the first reverse operation was initiated. It is possible to
override this behavior with the
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>clear-recorder</b>
</pre>
command. This command discards all recorded input and allows an alternate
future to take place.
<p>
Note that external changes to the simulation not under the control of the recorder
can make Hindsight operate somewhat unpredictably. It is recommended that any time
bookmarks before a non-replayable change of the simulation state is
deleted explicitly. Examples of such external changes are the modification of
a CPU register by hand or loading a boot image from the command line.
