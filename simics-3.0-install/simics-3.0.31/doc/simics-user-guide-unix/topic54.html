<p>
Synchronization in Simics is implemented by the
<b>central</b> module.  It defines two classes, the
<b>central-server</b> class and the
<b>central-client</b> class.
<p>
One Simics process is assigned the role of <em>server</em> for the
distributed simulation.  In this process, a
<b>central-server</b> object is added, and in every Simics
process that takes part in the distributed simulation, a
<b>central-client</b> object is added.
<p>
The client objects are connected to the server object, and then makes
sure that the Simics processes they belong to are kept synchronized with
each other.
<p>
If the Simics process that contains the server will run any
simulation, it too needs a <b>central-client</b> object.  An
alternative is to place the server in a completely dedicated Simics
process without any target machine configuration.  In that case it
does not need a client object.
<p>
All inter-process communication that is part of the simulation is
handled by <em><a name="label345">link object</a>s</em>, typically
<a name="label346">Ethernet</a> links, as described in chapter <a class="jdocu" href="topic45.html#label293">10</a>.
