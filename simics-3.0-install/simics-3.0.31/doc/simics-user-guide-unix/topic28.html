<h4 class="jdocu">6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Components</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
All machines in
<tt>[simics]/targets/</tt><i>architecture</i><tt></tt> use
components to create configurations. A component is typically the
smallest hardware unit that can be used when configuring a real
machine, and examples include motherboards, PCI cards, hard disks, and
backplanes. Components are usually implemented in Simics using several
configuration objects.
<p>
Components are intended to reduce the large configuration space provided by
Simics's objects and attributes, by only allowing combinations that match real
hardware. This greatly simplifies the creation of different systems by catching
many misconfigurations.
<p>
Components themselves are also configuration objects in Simics. But to avoid
confusion, they will always be referred to as components and the objects
implementing the actual functionality will be called objects.
<p>
<a name="label136"></a><h5 class="jdocu">6.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Component Definitions</h5 class="jdocu">


<a name="label137"></a>
<p>
All machines are based on a <em>top-level</em> component. The top-level
component is the root of the component hierarchy and is often a motherboard,
backplane, or system chassis.
<p>
When a component is created, it is in a <em>non-instantiated</em> state. At
this stage only the component itself exists, not the configuration objects
that will implement the actual functionality. Once a complete configuration
has been created, all included components can be <em>instantiated</em>. When
this happens, all objects are created and their attributes are set.
<p>
A <em>standalone</em> component is a component that can be instantiated without
being connected to a component hierarchy. A typical example is a hotplug
device, such as a PC Card (PCMCIA) or an Ethernet link.

<a name="label138"></a><h5 class="jdocu">6.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importing Component Commands</h5 class="jdocu">


Components in Simics are grouped by machine architecture, or by type, into
several collections. Before a component can be used in Simics, the
corresponding component collection has to be imported. What the import actually
does, is to add CLI commands for creating components in the collection. The
most common collections, that are not architecture specific, are
<tt>memory</tt>, <tt>pci</tt>, <tt>std</tt> and <tt>timing.</tt> To import all
collections that are used by the <i>Ebony</i> machine for example,
issue the following commands:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; import-pci-components
simics&gt; import-std-components
simics&gt; import-memory-components
simics&gt; import-ppc440gp-components
</pre>

<a name="label139"></a><h5 class="jdocu">6.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating Components</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
The <b>create-&lt;component&gt;</b> command is used to create
non-instantiated components. There is one create command for each component class.
The arguments to the create command represent attributes in the component.
Standalone components can be created both non-instantiated and instantiated.
To create instantiated components, there are <b>new-</b> commands, similar
to the <b>create-</b> commands.
<p>
The following code creates a non-instantiated 'ebony-board' component
representing an <em>Ebony Reference Board</em>, called 'board'
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; (create-ebony-board board cpu_frequency = 100
.......                           mac_address0 = "00:04:ac:00:50:00"
.......                           mac_address1 = "00:04:ac:00:50:01"
.......                           rtc_time = "2003-09-03 11:17:00 UTC")
.......
</pre>
The parentheses are needed to allow multi-line input. The command arguments
set the processor frequency, the MAC addresses of the on-board network
adapters, and the time and date of the real-time clock.
<p>
In multi machine configurations it is often useful to separate objects from the
different machines by name. The command <b>set-component-prefix
<i>str</i></b> causes all following <b>create-</b> commands to
prefix all created object names&#8212;including the names
of the components themselves&#8212;with the string <i>str</i>.
<p>

<a name="label140"></a><h5 class="jdocu">6.4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connectors</h5 class="jdocu">


<a name="label141"></a><a name="label142"></a>
<p>
A connector provides a means for a component to connect to other components.
Connectors have a defined direction: <i>up</i>, <i>down</i>, or <i>any</i>.
The direction is <i>up</i> if it needs an existing hierarchy to connect to;
for example, the PCI-bus connector in a PCI device must connect to a PCI slot.
A connector has a <i>down</i> direction if it extends the hierarchy downwards;
for example, a PCI slot is a connection downward from a board to a PCI device.
There are also non-directed connectors, with direction <i>any</i>. You can
only connect an <em>up</em> to a <em>down</em> connector or to an <em>any</em>
connector, and similar for <em>down</em> connectors. Connectors with the
<em>any</em> direction can not be connected together.
<p>
Many connectors have to be connected before the component is instantiated,
while others can be empty. A standalone component, as described above,
may have all connectors empty.
<p>
A <em>hotplug</em> connector supports connect and disconnect after
instantiation. Other connectors can only be connected, or left unconnected,
when the configuration is created and may not be modified after that point.
A <em>multi</em> connector supports connections to several other connectors.
A typical example of a <em>hotplug</em> <em>multi</em> connector is the Ethernet
link.
<p>
It is not possible to connect instantiated components with non-instantiated
ones. The reason is that the instantiated component expects the other to have
all objects already created, and need to access some of them to finish the
connection.
<p>
The <b>info</b> command of a component lists all connectors and some
information about them:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; board.info 
Information about board [class ebony-board]
===========================================

Implementing objects:

Connectors:
                     ddr-slot0 : mem-bus              down
                     ddr-slot1 : mem-bus              down
                         emac0 : ethernet-link        down  hotplug
                         emac1 : ethernet-link        down  hotplug
                     pci-slot0 : pci-bus              down
                     pci-slot1 : pci-bus              down
                     pci-slot2 : pci-bus              down
                     pci-slot3 : pci-bus              down
                         uart0 : serial               down  hotplug
                         uart1 : serial               down  hotplug
</pre>
Since the component in the example isn't instantiated yet, the list of
implementing objects is empty. The ebony-board has two slots for DDR SDRAM
modules, four PCI slots, two serial ports and two Ethernet ports. The memory
slot is not listed as <em>hotplug</em> since DDR modules have to be inserted
when the machine is configured initially, while serial and Ethernet ports
support connect and disconnect in run-time. As the ebony-board is a top-level
component, there are no <em>up</em> connectors.
<p>
To enable input and output for the simulated machine, the following commands
create a serial text console and connects it to the <tt>uart0</tt> connector of
the Ebony board. Since the text console only has a single connector, it does
not have to be specified in the connect command.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; board.connect uart0 (create-std-text-console)
Created non-instantiated 'std-text-console' component 'text_console_cmp0'.
</pre>
Since no name is given the console component, a unique name will be assigned
to it by the configuration system. The <b>create-</b> command returns
the name of the newly created component, allowing it to be used as in the
example above.
<p>
If the board only had a single serial connector, the <tt>uart0</tt> connector
name could have been left out as well.
<p>
Since the machine needs some memory to run, we also add a DDR memory module to
our example. A CLI variable is used to hold the name of the memory component.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; $ddr = (create-ddr-memory-module rank_density = 128 module_data_width = 64)
Created non-instantiated 'ddr-memory-module' component 'ddr_memory_module_cmp0'.
simics&gt; board.connect ddr-slot0 $ddr
</pre>

<a name="label143"></a><h5 class="jdocu">6.4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantiation</h5 class="jdocu">


When a component hierarchy has been created, it can be instantiated using the
<b>instantiate-components</b> command. This command will look for all
non-instantiated top-level components and instantiate all components below
them. The <b>instantiate-components</b> command can also be given
a specific component as argument. Then only that component will be
instantiated, including its hierarchy if it is a top-level component.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; instantiate-components
</pre>
<p>
If there are unconnected connectors left that may not be empty, the command
will return with an error.
<p>
When the instantiation is ready, all object and attributes have been created
and initialized. In our example, a text console window should have opened.
The hardware of the simulated Ebony board is now properly configured, but since
no software is loaded, it will not show any output on the console if the
machine is started.

<p>
The <b>list-components</b> command prints a list of all components in the
system. All connectors are included, and information about existing
connections between them.
<p>
The <b>info</b> name-space command provides static information about a
component, such as the implementing objects and a list of connectors.
<p>
The <b>status</b> name-space command provides dynamic information about a
component, such as attribute values and a list of all current connections. The
output from status in the Ebony example:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; board.status 
Status of board [class ebony-board]

                 cpu_frequency : 100
                  mac_address0 : 00:04:ac:00:50:00

The Eclipse-based User Interface includes a <em>Configuration Browser</em>
where the configuration can be browsed visually.

<a name="label145"></a><h5 class="jdocu">6.4.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accessing Objects from Components</h5 class="jdocu">


When doing more advanced configuration of a machine, it may be necessary to
access configuration objects and their attributes directly. Since the objects
are created by the component system automatically during instantiation, the
names of the implementing objects are not known in advance. For this reason it
is possible to query a component about what configuration objects are used to
implement it, using <b>get-component-object</b>. The argument is a name
for the object that is the same for all components of the same class. A list
of such names, and their mapping to actual configuration object names, is
available in the output from the <b>info</b> command. The next example
prints the <i>pc</i> attribute from the <i>cpu</i> object.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; p -x (board.get-component-object cpu)-&gt;pc
</pre>
The <b>get-component-object</b> is mainly useful in scripts, when running
interactively it is easy to find object names using the <b>info</b>
command, or <b>list-objects</b>.
<p>
The <b>get-component-object</b> command does not work for non-instantiated
components since they do not have any associated configuration objects. But it
is possible to access the <tt>pre_conf_object</tt>s of the non-instantiated
component from Python using the <tt>get_component_object()</tt> function.
This functions works for both instantiated and non-instantiated components,
and Python code as in the following example works in both cases:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
@print "0x%x" % get_component_object(conf.board, 'cpu').pc
</pre>
