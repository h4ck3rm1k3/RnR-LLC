<h4 class="jdocu">12.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakpoints</h4 class="jdocu">

    
    <a name="label353"></a>
<p>
    Like an ordinary debugger, Simics can run user binaries, allowing
    the user to set breakpoints, inspect state, single step, etc.
    Some difficult bugs are easier to find using various esoteric
    breakpoint types.  In Simics you can set breakpoints on:
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>memory accesses: any range and combination of read/write/execute</li>
    <li>time (number of cycles or instructions executed)</li>
    <li>instruction types, such as control register accesses</li>
    <li>device accesses</li>
    <li>output in the console</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Simics is fully deterministic, allowing you to narrow down the location of
    difficult bugs. If your session has interactive input, you can record it
    using the <b>recorder</b> <a name="label354"></a> and replay when you
    need to reproduce the same execution. If Hindsight is available, you can of
    course freely go forward and backward in time until you found the location
    of the problem.
<p>
    <a name="label355"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memory Breakpoints</h5 class="jdocu">

    
    <a name="label356"></a>
<p>
    A memory breakpoint stops the simulation whenever a memory location in a
    specified address interval is accessed. The address interval can be of
    arbitrary length and the type of the memory access can be specified as any
    combination of <i>read</i>, <i>write</i>, and <i>execute</i>.
<p>
    Physical memory breakpoints refer to addresses within a memory space, so
    the breakpoint itself is always connected to a specific memory space object
    in Simics. If this object is known by name (as <b>phys_mem0</b> in the
    following example), the breakpoint can be set with the <b>break</b>
    command:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>phys_mem0.break address = 0x10000 length = 16 -w</b>
    Breakpoint 1 set on address 0x10000, length 16 with access mode 'w'
</pre>
<p>
    Virtual memory breakpoints are handled by context objects:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>primary_context.break 0x1ff00</b>
    Breakpoint 1 set on address 0x1ff00 with access mode 'x'
</pre>
<p>
    Note that by default, all simulated processors in one Simics
    process share one context. If you want a virtual breakpoint to
    apply only to a subset of the processors, create a new context
    just for them:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>new-context foo</b>
    simics&gt; <b>cpu1.set-context foo</b>
    simics&gt; <b>cpu7.set-context foo</b>
    simics&gt; <b>foo.break 0xffffffffbfc008b8</b>
</pre>
<p>
    The <b>break</b> command can also be used without explicitly specifying
    an address space or context object. Instead you can prefix the address with
    <tt>p:</tt> for a physical address, or <tt>v:</tt> for a virtual
    address. The breakpoint will refer respectively to the memory space
    (physical address) or context (virtual address) connected to the current
    front-end processor (as specified with the <b>pselect</b> command).
    Note that, unless you have created a new context for the current processor,
    the breakpoint will apply to all processors.
<p>
    As you can see in the following example, Simics interprets a
    breakpoint address as virtual unless <tt>p:</tt> is explicitly
    specified:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>break v:0x4711</b>
    Breakpoint 2 set on address 0x4711 with access mode 'x'
    simics&gt; <b>break p:0x4711</b>
    Breakpoint 3 set on address 0x4711 with access mode 'x'
    simics&gt; <b>break 0x4711</b>
    Breakpoint 4 set on address 0x4711 with access mode 'x'
    Note: overlaps with breakpoint 2
</pre>
<p>
   <a name="label357"></a> 
   <a name="label358"></a>
   <a name="label359"></a> 
   <a name="label360"></a> 
   <a name="label361"></a>
   <a name="label362"></a> 
<p>
   Execution breakpoints can be modified with filter rules to only
   trigger when instructions match certain syntactical criteria. This
   feature is mainly useful with breakpoints covering large areas of
   memory.  The commands available are <b>set-prefix</b> (to match
   the start of an instruction), <b>set-substr</b> (to match a
   particular substring), and <b>set-pattern</b> (to match the bit
   pattern of the instruction).  The commands work by modifying an existing
   breakpoint, so you first have to set an execution breakpoint and
   then modify it to match only particular expressions.
<p>
   For example, to stop when an instruction with the name <tt>add</tt> is
   executed in a memory range from 0x10000 to 0x12000, use the following
   commands:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>break 0x10000 0x2000 -x</b>
    Breakpoint 1 set on address 0x10000, length 8192 with access mode 'x'
    simics&gt; <b>set-prefix 1 "add"</b>
</pre>
<p>
    Simics will stop when the first add instruction is encountered. For more
    information, see the <em>Simics Reference Manual</em> or use the
    <b>help break</b> command.
<p>
    
    <a name="label363"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporal Breakpoints</h5 class="jdocu">

    
    <a name="label364"></a>
<p>
    Unlike an ordinary debugger, Simics can handle temporal breakpoints, i.e.,
    breakpoints in time. As the concept of time is based on steps and cycles, a
    temporal breakpoint refers to a specific step or a cycle count for a given
    processor object:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>cpu0.cycle-break 100</b>
    simics&gt; <b>cpu0.step-break 100</b>
</pre>
<p>
    In the example above, the breakpoints are specified relative to the current
    time. It is also possible to set temporal breakpoints in absolute time
    (where 0 refers to the time when the original configuration was set up in
    Simics). When Hindsight is available, you can freely set time breakpoints
    in the past as well as in the future.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>cpu0.cycle-break-absolute 100</b>
    simics&gt; <b>cpu0.step-break-absolute 100</b>
</pre>
<p>
    All the commands <tt>cycle-break</tt>, <tt>step-break</tt>,
    <tt>cycle-break-absolute</tt>, and <tt>step-break-absolute</tt>,
    can be given without prefixing them with the CPU. Note that the
    in this case the commands will plant a breakpoint for current
    front-end processor (and not all processors).
<p>
    
    <a name="label365"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control Register Breakpoints</h5 class="jdocu">

    
    <a name="label366"></a>
<p>
    A control register breakpoint is triggered when a selected control register
    is accessed. The control register is specified either by name or number,
    and the access type can be any combination of <i>read</i> or
    <i>write</i>. For example:
        <p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>break-cr reg-name = asi</b>
</pre>
<p>
    Note that the exact arguments to this command depend on the target
    architecture. A list of available control registers can be obtained by
    tab-completing the <i>reg-name</i> argument. See the documentation for
    <b>break-cr</b> in the <em>Simics Reference Manual</em> for more
    information..
<p>
    
    <a name="label367"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I/O Breakpoints</h5 class="jdocu">

    
    <a name="label368"></a>
<p>
    An I/O breakpoint is always connected to a specific device object. The
    breakpoint is triggered when that device is accessed. The breakpoint is set
    using the <b>break-io</b> command, which take the device name as a
    parameter. For example, to break on accesses to the
    <b>hme0</b> device, we would use the following syntax:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>break-io object-name = hme0</b>
</pre>  
<p>
    A list of devices can be obtained by tab-completing the
    <i>object-name</i> argument.
<p>

  <a name="label370"></a>
  <a name="label371"></a>
<p>
  The graphics-console can be used to save and set graphical breakpoints. A
  graphical breakpoint is a rectangular area on the simulated display that
  triggers a hap (<tt>Gfx_Break_String</tt>) whenever the pixels inside
  the saved breakpoint rectangle exactly match those on the display.
<p>
  The following commands can be used to save and set breakpoints for a
  graphics console:
<p>
  <dl><dt><b> <b>&lt;gfx-console&gt;.save-break <em>filename</em> [<em>comment</em>]</b>
  </b></dt><dd>Let the user select a rectangular area inside the graphics console
  using the mouse pointer. To cancel the select operation press the right mouse
  button. The selected area will be saved as a graphical breakpoint file. You
  can add an optional comment that will be put in the beginning of the (binary)
  breakpoint file. </dd><dt><b> <b>&lt;gfx-console&gt;.save-break-xy <em>filename</em> <em>left</em>
  <em>top</em> <em>right</em> <em>bottom</em> [<em>comment</em>]</b> </b></dt><dd> Let
  the user specify a rectangular area inside the graphics console using the top
  left and bottom right corners coordinates. The selected area will be saved as
  a binary graphical breakpoint file. You can add an optional comment that will
  be put at the beginning of the breakpoint file.</dd><dt><b> <b>&lt;gfx-console&gt;.break <em>filename</em></b> </b></dt><dd>Activate a
  previously saved breakpoint and return a breakpoint id. When a graphical
  breakpoint is reached, it is immediately deleted and a
  <tt>Gfx_Break_String</tt> hap is triggered. If no callbacks for this
  hap were registered, Simics halts execution and returns to the command
  prompt. </dd><dt><b> <b>&lt;gfx-console&gt;.delete <em>id</em></b> </b></dt><dd>Delete the
  breakpoint associated with <em>id</em>. </dd></dl>

    The text console can set breakpoints on the occurrence of certain
    character sequences in the output sent to the screen.  
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>To set a  breakpoint, use the command <b><em>console</em>.break
    <em>string</em></b>. Simics will stop when <em>string</em> appears

<p>
    <li>All breakpoints can be listed using the

    <a name="label374"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.1.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Instructions and Magic Breakpoints</h5 class="jdocu">

    
<p>
    For each simulated processor architecture, a special no-operation
    instruction has been chosen to be a <b>magic instruction</b> for the
    simulator. When the simulator executes such an instruction, it triggers a
    <tt>Core_Magic_Instruction</tt> hap and calls all the callbacks functions
    registered on this hap (see chapter <a class="jdocu" href="topic35.html#label187">8</a>
    to get more information about haps).
<p>
    If the architecture makes it possible, an immediate value is encoded in the
    magic instruction. When the hap is triggered, this value is passed as an
    argument to the hap handlers. This provides the user with a rudimentary way
    of passing information from the simulated system to the hap handler.
<p>
    Magic instructions have to be compiled in the binary files that are
    executed on the target. The file <tt>magic-instruction.h</tt> in 
    <tt>[simics]/src/include/simics/</tt>
    defines a <tt>MAGIC(</tt><i>n</i><tt>)</tt> macro that can be used to
    place magic instructions in your program, where <i>n</i> is the
    immediate value to use.
<p>
    <a name="label375"></a>
<p>
    <hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> The declaration of the macros are heavily dependent on the compiler
    used, so you may get an error message telling you that your compiler is not
    supported. You will need to write by yourself the inline assembly
    corresponding to the magic instruction you want to use. The GCC compiler
    should always be supported.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
    <hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Using magic instructions in other languages than C requires
    the ability to insert inline assembler in a program, or at least
    the ability to call arbitrary functions written in assembly.  For
    example, in Java it would be necessary to use the JNI
    interface. As always, check your compiler and language
    documentation for details on how to enter inline assembly. <hr class="jdocu_note">

    <i>n</i> can take is provided in figure <a class="jdocu" href="#label376">3</a>.

<p>
    Here is a simple pseudo-code example:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
#include "magic-instruction.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        initialize();
        MAGIC(1);                     <i>tell the simulator to start</i>
                                      <i>the cache simulation</i>
        do_something_important();
        MAGIC(2);                     <i>tell the simulator to stop</i>
                                      <i>the cache simulation</i>
        clean_up();
}
</pre>
<p>
    This code needs to be coupled with a callback registered on the
    magic instruction hap to handle what happens when the simulator
    encounters a magic instruction with the arguments 1 or 2 (in this
    example, to start and stop the cache simulation).
<p>
    Simics implements a special handling of magic instructions called <b>magic
    breakpoints</b>. A magic breakpoint occurs if magic breakpoints are enabled
    and if the parameter <i>n</i> of a magic instruction matches a
    special condition. When a magic breakpoint is triggered, the simulation
    stops and returns to prompt.
<p>
    Magic breakpoints can be enabled and disabled with the commands
    <b>magic-break-enable</b> <a name="label377"></a> and
    <b>magic-break-disable</b> <a name="label378"></a>. The
    condition on <i>n</i> for a magic instruction to be recognized as a
    magic breakpoint is the following:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
      n == 0 || (n &amp; 0x3f0000) == 0x40000
</pre>
<p>
    Note that the value 0 is included for architectures where no immediate can
    be specified. The file <tt>magic-instruction.h</tt> defines a macro
    called MAGIC_BREAKPOINT that places a magic instruction with a correct
    parameter value in your program.
<p>
    On architectures that only offer a single magic instruction (x86 and
    Alpha), more information can be passed from the
    simulation to the magic instruction hap handler by putting data
    values in machine registers prior to triggering the magic
    instruction.
    <p>
    As a concrete example, on the x86, the hap argument can only be 0. This can
    be worked around by putting extra information into register <tt>eax</tt>
    before executing the <tt>MAGIC(0)</tt> magic instruction.  The hap handler
    for magic instructions then needs to read the value from <tt>eax</tt> and
    do different things depending on its contents.
<p>
    The following is an example program implementing this technique,
    using the <tt>gcc</tt> compiler's syntax for inserting inline
    assembler:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
#include "stdio.h"
#include "magic-instruction.h"

#define MY_MAGIC(n) do {                                        \
    asm volatile ("movl %0, %%eax" : : "g" (n) : "eax");        \
    MAGIC(0);                                                   \
} while (0)

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello,\n");
    MY_MAGIC(1);
    printf("World!\n");
    MY_MAGIC(2);
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
    The hap handler for this would look something like the following:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
@def call_back_1(cpu):
    pr("call back one triggered\n")

@def call_back_2(cpu):
    pr("another one here\n")

@def hap_callback(user_arg, cpu, arg):
    eax = cpu.eax             # read value passed from program
    if eax == 1:              # take appropriate action
        call_back_1(cpu)
    elif eax == 2:
        call_back_2(cpu)
    else:
        print "Unknown callback, eax is", eax
        SIM_break_simulation("snore")

@SIM_hap_add_callback("Core_Magic_Instruction", hap_callback, None)
</pre>
<p>
    The same technique can be applied to other architectures, but you
    need to adapt the names of the registers involved. 
<p>
    <hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> This method is slightly intrusive since a register will change its
    value.  It is thus important to make sure that the compiler is aware of the
    change to the register so that no broken code is emitted; in the
    <tt>gcc</tt> compiler, this is specified in the last argument to the
    <tt>asm()</tt> statement.<hr class="jdocu_note">
