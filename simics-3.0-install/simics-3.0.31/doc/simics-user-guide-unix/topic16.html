<i>Hindsight</i> enables the simulation to run backwards in time. To enable
Hindsight, we have to set an initial <i>time bookmark</i>.
Time bookmarks are set with the <b>set-bookmark</b> command.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>set-bookmark booted</b>
simics&gt;  <b>c</b>
</pre>
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Typing <b>c</b> is a shorthand for <b>continue</b>.
<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
To demonstrate the possibilities Hindsight gives, we will accidentally
remove an important file on the simulated system. Enter the following
commands in the simulated system's terminal:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
root@firststeps: ~# <b>rm /bin/ls</b>
root@firststeps: ~# <b>ls /</b>
ls: No such file or directory
</pre>
<p>
The program <b>ls</b> has been removed. You can no longer list
the contents of a directory.
Let us use Hindsight to recover <b>ls</b>.
<p>
<b>ptime</b> is a useful command that shows the number of executed
instructions and the current simulated time.
We will use it to show that the time have advanced backwards.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
<b>[press control-C]</b>
simics&gt;  <b>ptime</b>
processor                 steps             cycles    time [s]
cpu0                16667617210        16667617210     166.676
simics&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
The <b>skip-to</b> command can be used to quickly jump to a
previous point in time.
We will use the bookmark we created before as our
time-travel destination.
Note that it is not possible to reverse past the first bookmark.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>skip-to bookmark = booted</b>
simics&gt;  <b>ptime</b>
processor                 steps             cycles    time [s]
cpu0                13586370338        13586370338     135.864
simics&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
The system is now in the state it was before the file was erased.
Now, we run forward again.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>c</b>
</pre>
<p>
When you type something in the terminal, you will notice that it
does not respond any longer! Instead the same commands as before will
be replayed.
<p>
This behavior is intentional, and keeps the deterministic property
of the simulation,
which is invaluable when debugging.
Keystrokes, network traffic and any other input is replayed until
the last known time is reached.
<p>
In our example, this is not what we want. To erase all knowledge
about the future, run the <b>clear-recorder</b> command.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
<b>[press control-C]</b>
simics&gt;  <b>skip-to bookmark = booted</b>
simics&gt;  <b>clear-recorder</b>
Replay of recorded input finished; Simics is now running normally
simics&gt;  <b>c</b>
</pre>
<p>
Resume the simulation and enter the following command:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
root@firststeps: ~# <b>ls /</b>
LICENSE     dev         host        lost+found  proc        tmp
bin         etc         lib         mnt         root        usr
boot        home        linuxrc     opt         sbin        var
root@firststeps: ~#
</pre>
<p>
<b>ls</b> works again!
