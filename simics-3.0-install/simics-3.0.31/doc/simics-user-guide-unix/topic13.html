<p>
The installation of Simics is made to be shared among several users, and
therefore you first need to create your own <i>workspace</i>.
A workspace is a place where you have write permission and can save
your own Simics files.
<p>
Type the following commands in a terminal, to
create a workspace called <tt>simics-workspace</tt> in your home
directory. Replace
<tt>[simics]</tt> with your Simics installation directory.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
joe@computer: ~$ <b>[simics]/bin/workspace-setup ~/simics-workspace</b>
Setting up Simics workspace directory: /home/joe/simics-workspace
[..]
joe@computer: ~$ <b>cd simics-workspace</b>
joe@computer: simics-workspace$
</pre>
<p>
The preconfigured <i>Ebony</i> machines reside under
the directory
<tt>targets/ebony/</tt>. Launch
the <tt>firststeps</tt> configuration in the command-line environment
of Simics.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
joe@computer: simics-workspace$ <b>./simics targets/ebony/ebony-linux-firststeps.simics</b>
</pre>
<p>

Simulation starts in suspended mode, and the Simics prompt will appear,
waiting for you to give further commands.
<p>
In this guide, interaction with the Simics console will be
presented in <tt>monospace</tt> font. User input will be presented in
<tt><b>bold font</b></tt>.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt;  <b>this is something that you should type</b>
This is output from Simics
</pre>
<p>
<i>Ebony</i>'s screen will be shown in an additional
window. It is initially empty before the machine is started.
