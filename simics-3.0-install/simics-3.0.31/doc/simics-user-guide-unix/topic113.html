<p>
As mentioned in the previous section, Simics triggers haps for
hardware events such as processor privilege level changes, making it
easy to change contexts in response to those. It does not trigger haps
in response to software events, such as when the currently executing
process changes, because it knows nothing about things such as
processes. But if you know how the operating system works, you can
inspect the information that Simics does provide, and figure out all
kinds of stuff.
<p>
A <em>process tracker</em> does just that; inspects the simulated
operating system, and triggers haps when interesting things occur.
<p>
Typically, a new tracker needs to be written for each architecture/OS
combination. Simics comes with two trackers:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
  <li><b>cpu-mode-tracker</b>, which only distinguishes
      between user and supervisor mode (but works on all targets and
      operating systems).</li>
<p>
  <li><b>linux-process-tracker</b>, which tracks
      processes on Linux on PowerPC, UltraSPARC and x86 targets.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
Their source code can be found in <tt>src/extensions</tt>. The
intention is that this will be helpful if you would like to write a
tracker for some other architecture/OS combination.
<p>
Note that a tracker is watching over a specific set of processors.
This set should typically contain all processors that run an operating
system together, and no other processors. That way, processes that
migrate between processors will not get lost, and processes running in
different operating system instances will not be mixed up. If there is
more than one operating system running in the simulation, they will
need separate trackers.
<p>
A new <b>cpu-mode-tracker</b> can be created like this:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>new-cpu-mode-tracker name = tracker0</b>
New cpu mode tracker tracker0 created.
simics&gt; <b>tracker0.add-processor cpu0</b>
</pre>
<p>
Creating a <b>linux-process-tracker</b> requires a little more work:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>new-linux-process-tracker name = tracker0</b>
New process tracker tracker0 created.
simics&gt; <b>tracker0.add-processor cpu0</b>
simics&gt; <b>tracker0.autodetect-parameters</b>
</pre>
<p>
Notice the added command
<b>tracker0.autodetect-parameters</b>. This makes the process
tracker examine memory to figure out what operating system the target
machine is actually running. This means that the target system must be
booted before this command is issued. If that is not an option, the OS
version can be specified explicitly as an argument to
<b>new-linux-process-tracker</b>.  The process tracker just
created should be suitable to try out the examples below.
<p>
If the trackers distributed with Simics do not fit your needs, there
are some things to think about when creating a new tracker. (This part
is beneficial to read even if you use the trackers shipped with
Simics, as it explains the interface to the tracker, with some usage
examples.) A tracker must do two things:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
  <li>Monitor a specific set of processors, and trigger the
      <tt>Core_Trackee_Active</tt> hap when a trackee becomes active
      or inactive on one of them.</li>
<p>
  <li>Answer questions about trackees by implementing the
      <tt>tracker</tt> interface.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
(It says "<a name="label568">tracker</a>" instead of "process tracker", and
"<a name="label569">trackee</a>" instead of "process" in the text above because
the things being tracked are not necessarily processes.
<b>cpu-mode-tracker</b>, for example, tracks processor
privilege levels.)
<p>


If the tracker tracks processes on a Unix-like operating system, it
may additionally do the following:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
  <li>Monitor the processors, and trigger the
     <tt>Core_Trackee_Exec</tt> hap when a process calls the
     <b><i>exec</i></b> system call on one of them.</li>
<p>
  <li>Answer questions about processes by implementing the
      <tt>tracker_unix</tt> interface.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
And if it wants to play nice with automatic configuring of process
trackers, there is one more thing to do:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
  <li>Expose any parameter settings it requires through the
      <tt>tracker_settings</tt> interface.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
These haps and interfaces are documented in the Reference Manual. The
tracker typically implements this functionality by listening to haps
such as <tt>Core_Mode_Change</tt> and <tt>Core_Exception</tt>, and
knowing in which registers and memory locations the operating system
stores interesting information.
<p>

Clearly, using just the basic interface (the
<tt>Core_Trackee_Active</tt> hap and the <tt>tracker</tt>
interface), it is easy to make a context follow the currently active
trackee (this example assumes that there is a tracker called
<b>tracker0</b>):
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
def set_context(user_arg, tracker, tid, cpu, active):
    if active:
        cpu.current_context = conf.my_little_context
    else:
        cpu.current_context = conf.primary_context
current_tid = conf.tracker0.iface.tracker.active_trackee(
    conf.tracker0, conf.cpu0)
SIM_hap_add_callback_obj_index("Core_Trackee_Active", conf.tracker0,
                               0, set_context, None, current_tid)
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>current_tid</tt> is set to the ID of the trackee that is
active <i>when we run this code</i>.
<b><i>SIM_hap_add_callback_obj_index</i></b> is then used to cause our
callback function <tt>set_context</tt> to be called every time the
trackee with this ID becomes active or inactive. For example, if
<b>tracker0</b> is a process tracker, <tt>current_tid</tt> will be
an ID representing the currently executing process (or the operating
system&#8212;whichever was executing at the time). The callback
function then ensures that <b>my_little_context</b> is active
whenever that process is active, and that <b>primary_context</b>
is active at all other times.
<p>
Using the Unix process tracker interface as well (the
<tt>Core_Trackee_Exec</tt> hap and the <tt>tracker_unix</tt>
interface), we can do more complicated things, such as waiting for a
specific binary (<tt>ifconfig</tt> in this example) to be executed,
then follow any process that executes it:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
def exec_hap(user_arg, tracker, tid, cpu, binary):
    if binary.endswith("ifconfig"):
        def active_hap(user_arg, tracker, tid, cpu, active):
            if active:
                cpu.current_context = conf.my_little_context
            else:
                cpu.current_context = conf.primary_context
        SIM_hap_add_callback_obj_index("Core_Trackee_Active", tracker,
                                       0, active_hap, None, tid)
SIM_hap_add_callback_obj("Core_Trackee_Exec", conf.tracker0,
                         0, exec_hap, None)
</pre>
Section <a class="jdocu" href="topic114.html#label570">21.3</a> reveals how to do this
without having to write scripts.
<p>
Switching contexts is not all that can be done with process
trackers. Here is another example that prints the number of steps a
user process is running continuously in user mode. In this case we are
looking at the program "ls".
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
start_cycle = 0

def exec_hap(user_arg, tracker, tid, cpu, binary):
    global total_cycles, start_cycle
    if binary.endswith("ls"):
        def active_hap(user_arg, tracker, tid, cpu, active):
            global total_cycles, start_cycle
            if active:
                start_cycle = SIM_cycle_count(cpu)
            else:
                print "ls ran for", (SIM_cycle_count(cpu) - start_cycle), "cycles"
        start_cycle = SIM_cycle_count(cpu)
        SIM_hap_add_callback_obj_index("Core_Trackee_Active", tracker,
                                       0, active_hap, None, tid)
SIM_hap_add_callback_obj("Core_Trackee_Exec", conf.tracker0,
                         0, exec_hap, None)
</pre>
Section <a class="jdocu" href="topic61.html#label396">12.3</a> has an example of how to use process trackers in symbolic debugging.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Remember to use the CLI command <b>&lt;tracker&gt;.activate</b>
(or, equivalently, call the <b><i>activate</i></b> function of the
<tt>tracker</tt> interface) before trying to use a
