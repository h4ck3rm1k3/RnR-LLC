<p>
Hindsight optimizes for certain reverse operations that are expected to be common.
One example of this is that skipping to bookmarks can be faster than skipping to
some other location.
<p>
The usage of time bookmarks has a certain impact on overall performance since it
implicitly enables Hindsight support. Normal performance is always obtained if all
time bookmarks are removed.
<p>
It is possible to tune certain reverse execution parameters in order to optimize
operations for a particular usage pattern (although the default settings should work well in
most situations). Tradeoffs exists between:
<p>
<ul>
<li>reverse performance</li>
<li>forward performance</li>
<li>memory utilization</li>
<li>scope of reversibility</li>
</ul>
The <b>rexec-limit</b> command is the primary tool for adjusting the balance, e.g.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>rexec-limit steps = 20000000 </b>
    simics&gt; <b>rexec-limit size_mb = 200 </b>
</pre>
<p>
The steps limit indicate that the scope of interest is at most the specified number of steps.
By imposing a steps limit, resources can be spent more effectively with
the drawback that reversal past the limit may not possible. By default, no steps limit is imposed.
<p>
The size limit imposes a limit on the amount of memory Hindsight may use. If the limit is exceeded,
reverse performance will be traded for less memory consumption.
