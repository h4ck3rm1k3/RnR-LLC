<h4 class="jdocu">13.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instruction Profiling</h4 class="jdocu">

    
<p>
    <hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Instruction profiling is not yet implemented for targets
    other than SPARC, PowerPC, x86, and MIPS, and is only available
    when Simics is started with <i>-stall</i>.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
    Simics can maintain an exact execution profile: every single taken branch
    is counted, showing you exactly what code was executed and how often branches
    were taken.
<p>
    To get started with instruction profiling, type
    <b>cpu0.start-instruction-profiling</b> at the prompt (assuming the
    machine you are simulating has a processor called <b>cpu0</b>). This
    has the same effect as if you had executed the following two commands:
<p>
    <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>new-branch-recorder cpu0_branch_recorder physical</b>
    simics&gt; <b>cpu0.attach-branch-recorder cpu0_branch_recorder</b>
    </pre>
<p>
    These commands create a <a name="label435">branch recorder</a> and attach it to the
    <b>cpu0</b> processor. All branches taken by <b>cpu0</b> will now
    be recorder in <b>cpu0_branch_recorder</b>.
<p>
    You need to use these separate commands instead of
    <b>start-instruction-profiling</b> if you want a branch recorder with a
    particular name, or if you want to record virtual instead of physical
    addresses.
<p>
    A branch recorder remembers the source and destination address of each
    branch, as well as the number of times the branch has been taken. It does
    <em>not</em> remember in which order the branches happened, so it cannot be
    used to reconstruct an execution trace (if you want that, you have to use
    the <b>trace</b> module, which is slower and generates much more
    profiling data).  There is however enough information to compute a number
    of interesting statistics. To get a list of what the branch recorder can
    do, type:
<p>
    <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>cpu0_branch_recorder.address-profile-info</b>
    cpu0_branch_recorder has 6 address profiler views:
    View 0: execution count
       64-bit addresses, granularity 4 bytes
    View 1: branches from
       64-bit addresses, granularity 4 bytes
    View 2: branches to
       64-bit addresses, granularity 4 bytes
    View 3: interrupted execution count
       64-bit addresses, granularity 4 bytes
    View 4: exceptions from
       64-bit addresses, granularity 4 bytes
    View 5: exceptions to
       64-bit addresses, granularity 4 bytes
    </pre>
<p>
    An address profiler is an object whose data can be meaningfully displayed
    as a count for each address interval. The output of the last command
    indicates that <b>cpu0_branch_recorder</b> is an address profiler with
    six separate <em>views</em>; i.e., there are six separate ways of displaying
    its data as counts for each four-byte interval.
<p>
    View 0 is the execution count per instruction, conveniently represented as
    one count per four-byte address interval since the instructions of the
    simulated machine (a SPARC in this case) are all four bytes long and
    aligned on four-byte boundaries. Views 1 and 2 count the number of times
    the processor has branched from and to each instruction, except when the
    branch is caused by an exception (or exception return); those
    branches are counted separately by views 4 and 5. View 3, finally, counts
    the number of times an instruction was started but not completed because an
    exception occurred.
<p>
    When you are done recording for the moment, type:
<p>
    <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>cpu0.detach-branch-recorder cpu0_branch_recorder</b>
    </pre>
<p>
    to detach the branch recorder; it will stop recording new branches,
    but the already collected branches will remain in the branch recorder
    (until you type <b>cpu0_branch_recorder.clean</b> at the prompt). You
    can reattach it again at any time:
<p>
    <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>cpu0.attach-branch-recorder cpu0_branch_recorder</b>
    </pre>
<p>
    Section <a class="jdocu" href="topic65.html#label438">13.3</a> explains how to access the
    recorded data.
<p>
    <a name="label436"></a><h5 class="jdocu">13.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual Instruction Profiling</h5 class="jdocu">

    
<p>
    Branch recorders can record virtual instead of physical addresses;
    just say so when you create them:
<p>
    <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>new-branch-recorder ls_profile virtual</b>
    </pre>
<p>
    Once it has been created, the new branch recorder object behaves just the
    same as a physical profiler would, except for one thing: when you want a
    physical profile, you typically expect the profiler to collect statistics
    from the whole system, but when you want a virtual profile, you probably
    are interested in one process (or the kernel) only.
<p>
    To be consistent with the name of the branch recorder we just
    created, let us collect a virtual profile of a run of the
    <tt>ls</tt> program. The problem is to have the branch recorder
    attached when <tt>ls</tt> is running, and detached when other
    processes are running. This is the same problem that we had in
    chapter <a class="jdocu" href="topic61.html#label396">12.3</a>, when we wanted a
    <b>context</b> object to be active precisely when a given
    process was active.
<p>
    Unfortunately, we cannot use the same convenient tools for branch
    recorders as we did for contexts, since Simics does not yet
    support that. We can use the process tracker directly, though,
    with Python scripts very similar to those in section <a class="jdocu" href="topic113.html#label566">21.2</a>:
<p>
    <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    def exec_hap(user_arg, tracker, tid, cpu, binary):
        if binary.endswith("ls"):
            def set_profiler(user_arg, tracker, tid, cpu, active):
                if active:
                    cpu.branch_recorders = [conf.ls_profile]
                else:
                    cpu.branch_recorders = []
            SIM_hap_add_callback_obj_index("Core_Trackee_Active", tracker,
                                           0, set_profiler, None, tid)
    SIM_hap_add_callback_obj("Core_Trackee_Exec", conf.tracker0,
                             0, exec_hap, None)
    </pre>
<p>
    This script assumes the existence of a process tracker called
    <b>tracker0</b>, and the branch recorder <b>ls_profile</b>
    that we created above.
<p>
    <hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Remember to use the CLI command
    <b>&lt;tracker&gt;.activate</b> (or, equivalently, call the
    <b><i>activate</i></b> function of the <tt>tracker</tt>
    interface) before trying to use a tracker.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
    First, it listens for the
    <tt>Core_Trackee_Exec</tt> hap, which is triggered when any
    process in the system calls the <tt>exec</tt> system call. When that
    happens, and the binary being executed is called "ls", the script
    starts listening for the <tt>Core_Trackee_Active</tt> hap for that
    process, attaching the branch recorder <b>ls_profile</b> to
    the processor when the process becomes active, and detaching it
    when the process becomes inactive.
