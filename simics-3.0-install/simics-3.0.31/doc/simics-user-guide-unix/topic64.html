<h4 class="jdocu">13.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Profiling</h4 class="jdocu">

    
<p>
    In addition to recording branches, Simics can record memory reads and
    writes by physical address&#8212;all of it simultaneously if you like.
    Start it like this:
<p>
    <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>cpu0.add-memory-profiler read</b>
    [cpu0] New read memory profiler added: cpu0_read_mem_prof
    </pre>
<p>
    This creates a new data profiler called <b>cpu0_read_mem_prof</b>,
    which will keep track of all reads performed by <b>cpu0</b> until you
    detach it:
<p>
    <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>cpu0.remove-memory-profiler read</b>
    </pre>
<p>
    Like branch recorders, data profilers retain their recorded data after
    being detached, and may be reattached later. They may also be attached to
    another processor, even while they are still attached to the first one.
<p>
    And, like branch recorders, data profilers are also address profilers. This
    means that while they may be different under the hood, they present their
    data the same way:
<p>
    <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; <b>cpu0_read_mem_prof.address-profile-info</b>
    cpu0_read_mem_prof has 1 address profiler view:
    View 0: data profiler
       64-bit addresses, granularity 32 bytes
    </pre>
<p>
    However, unlike branch recorders, data profilers can only record
    physical addresses.
<p>
    Section <a class="jdocu" href="topic65.html#label438">13.3</a> explains how to access the
    recorded data.
<p>
    Cache models provide profiling on cache hits and misses. See
    chapter <a class="jdocu" href="topic86.html#label517">18</a> for more information.
