<p>
    Simics is an <i>efficient, instrumented, system level instruction
    set simulator</i>.
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>Whereas an <i>emulator</i> is focused on executing a program
    as quickly and accurately as possible, a <b>simulator</b>, in
    addition, is designed from the ground up to gather information on
    the execution and in general be a flexible tool. Simics is
    not a monolithic program, it is a complete platform on which 
    simulation-based tools can be built.</li>
<p>
    <li><b>efficient</b> means that Simics is designed to run
    simulations very fast. Often, a Simics simulation will run as fast
    as the real hardware, or even faster. In fact, in its class of
    tools, Simics is the fastest simulator ever implemented.</li>
<p>
    <li><b>instrumented</b> means that Simics was designed not to run
    just the target system programs, but to gather a great deal of
    information during runtime. Many simulators are simply fast
    emulators with instrumentation added as an afterthought, making
    the tool slow down considerably when running with high
    levels of information-gathering enabled. 
<p>
    Simics, by contrast, is specifically designed to achieve
    good performance even with a high level of instrumentation and
    very large workloads. Simics provides a variety of
    statistics in its default configuration and allows
    various add-ons to be developed by power users and plugged into
    the simulator.</li>
<p>
    <li>Simics is <b>system level</b>, meaning that it models a target
    computer at the level that an operating system acts. Thus, Simics
    models the binary interfaces to buses, interrupt controllers,
    disks, video memory, etc. This means that Simics can run
    anything that the target system can, i.e.,
    arbitrary workloads. Simics can boot unmodified operating system
    kernels from raw disk dumps.</li>
<p>
    <li><b>instruction set simulator</b> means that Simics models the
    target system at the level of individual instructions, executing
    them one at a time. This is the lowest level of the hardware that
    software has ready access to. Simulating at this level allows
    Simics to be <i>system level</i>, yet still permits an
    <i>efficient</i> design.</li>
<p>
    </ul>
<p>
    Simics fully virtualizes the target computer, allowing simulation
    of multiprocessor systems as well as a cluster of independent
    systems, and even networks,
    regardless of the simulator host type. The virtualization also
    allows Simics to be <i>cross platform</i>. For instance, Simics/SunFire can
    run on a Linux/x86 system, thus simulating a 64-bit big-endian system on
    a 32-bit little endian host.
<p>
    The end uses for Simics include program analysis, computer
    architecture research, and kernel debugging.  The analysis support
    includes code profiling and memory hierarchy simulation (i.e., cache
    hierarchies). Debugging support includes a wide variety of
    breakpoint types. The support for system-level simulation allows
    operating system code to be developed and analyzed.
