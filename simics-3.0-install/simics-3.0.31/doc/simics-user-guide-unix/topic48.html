<h4 class="jdocu">10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparing for the Examples</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
The examples in section <a class="jdocu" href="topic49.html#label306">10.4</a> use the
simulated machine <em>enterprise</em>. It is a simulated x86 machine (PC) with
a Red Hat Linux 7.3 installation. Unfortunately enterprise does not have any
services running that can be used to test access from the real network to the
simulated machine by default. To get around this we can turn on the
<em>echo</em> service on TCP port 7.
<p>
To be able to try more than one example without repeating the configuration
steps, you can prepare a checkpoint that you can then start from when trying
the examples. Simply follow these steps:
<p>
<ol>
<p>
    <li>Start Simics with <tt>enterprise-common.simics</tt> script in
    <tt>[simics]/targets/x86-440bx</tt> directory.</li>
<p>
    <li>The simulation of the enterprise machine can be very fast, so you may
    want to run the <b>enable-real-time-mode</b> command at the Simics
    prompt. This will limit the simulation speed to real-time speed, so that
    the screen saver will not kick in annoyingly fast.</li>
<p>
    <li>Start the simulation and let the enterprise machine boot. Log in as
    <tt>root</tt> when you get to the login prompt. No password is
    required.</li>
<p>
    <li>Start <tt>pico</tt>, a simple text editor, to edit the file
    <tt>/etc/xinetd.d/echo</tt>:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
[root@enterprise root]# <b>pico /etc/xinetd.d/echo</b>
</pre>
<p>
    If you prefer <em>Emacs</em> or <em>vi</em>, those editors are also
    available.</li>
<p>
    <li>Change the line that reads
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
        disable         = yes
</pre>
<p>
to
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
        disable         = no
</pre>
<p>
    You can use the arrow keys to navigate in the file.</li>
<p>
    <li>Press <tt>Ctrl</tt> and <tt>o</tt> to save the file. Press return when
    asked for the file name.</li>
<p>
    <li>Press <tt>Ctrl</tt> and <tt>x</tt> to exit <tt>pico</tt>.</li>
<p>
    <li>Restart the server handling the echo port:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
[root@enterprise root]# <b>/etc/init.d/xinetd restart</b>
</pre>
<p>
    You should see a couple of messages about the <tt>xinetd</tt> service
    stopping and starting again.</li>
<p>
    <li>To verify that the echo service started successfully, telnet to the
    echo port.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
[root@enterprise root]# <b>telnet localhost 7</b>
</pre>
<p>
    Type a line of text and press enter, and it should be echoed on the
    simulated console.
<p>
    To quit the telnet session, first press <tt>Ctrl</tt> and <tt>5</tt>, and
    then type <tt>q</tt> and press enter at the <tt>telnet&gt;</tt> prompt that
    appears.</li>
<p>

    <li>Save a checkpoint using the <b>write-configuration</b> command now
    that the simulated machine has been configured. You can then restart from
    this point if you want to try several of the examples, or if you run into
    problems.</li>
<p>


</ol>
<p>
In the examples, the simulated machine sometimes needs to be
reconfigured. Since it is running Linux, the Linux configuration commands are
used. If you are using a simulated machine with a different operating system
you should configure the simulated machine similarly, but the commands may of
course be different.
<p>
In the examples, the simulation host has the IP address 10.0.0.129 and the real
host that communicates with the simulated network has the IP address
10.0.0.240. You should generally replace these addresses with the address of
your simulation host and another host on the your real network.
<p>
The enterprise machine uses its default IP address 10.10.0.15.
<p>

The examples assume that you have a host on the real network that you can
telnet to. You should check that you can telnet from the simulation host to the
other real host. Just run <tt>telnet &lt;ip&gt;</tt> in a terminal window,
where <i>&lt;ip&gt;</i> is the IP address of the other real host. If that does
not work, you should not expect to be able to telnet from the simulated machine
either.
<p>

If you do not have any hosts that accept telnet connections on your network,
you can test the connection by entering <tt>GET / HTTP/1.0</tt> and a blank
line to port 80 of a web server on your network instead. This should return the
HTML content of the start page of the server. Here 64.233.161.104
(www.google.com) is used, replace it with the IP address of your web server:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
[root@enterprise root]# <b>telnet 64.233.161.104 80</b>
Trying 64.233.161.104...
Connected to 64.233.161.104.

<b>GET / HTTP/1.0</b>

<p>
Make sure that the telnet or web server you use is on the same IP subnet as the
simulation host, since you may not be able to access other subnets, depending
on what connection type you are using.
