<p>
Simics includes a <em>configuration system</em> used to describe the state of
the simulated machines.
<p>
Simics's configuration system is object-oriented: a simulated machine is
represented as a set of <em>objects</em> that interact when the simulated time
advances. Typically, processors, memories and devices are modeled as
objects. Each object is defined by a number of properties that are called
<em>attributes</em>. A processor object, for example, will have an attribute
called <i>freq_mhz</i> to define its clock frequency (in MHz).
<p>
Simics's configuration system is flexible: it is possible to create and delete
objects dynamically, as well as access the attributes of all objects for
reading and writing at any time.
<p>
Simics's configuration system allows its elements to be saved so that a complete
simulated machine state can be written to a set of files. This set of files is
called a <em>checkpoint</em>.
<p>
This chapter describes the Simics configuration system as well as the different
layers built on top of it to handle more specific tasks:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
  <li>Checkpoints: how a simulated state is saved and restored via
  checkpointing;</li>
<p>
  <li>Inspection: how the simulated state can be examined and changed during
  simulation;</li>
<p>
  <li>Start Scripts: the components and scripts used to define the initial
  state of a machine in the examples provided with Simics.</li>
</ul>
