<p>
Simics's configuration system can save the complete state of a simulation in a
portable way. This functionality is known as <em>checkpointing</em>, and the
set of files that represent the elements of the systems are called a
<em>checkpoint</em>.
<p>
Saving and restoring a checkpoint can be done on the command-line with the
<b>write-configuration</b> and <b>read-configuration</b> commands.
<p>
A checkpoint consists of the following files:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>A main file called <em>configuration file</em> (usually terminated by
<tt>.conf</tt>, but this is only a convention). This file is a text
representation of the objects present in the system.</li>
<p>
<li>An optional raw data file (described below), having the same name as the
configuration file, with the suffix <tt>.raw</tt> appended.</li>
<p>
<li>Optional image files (described in section <a class="jdocu" href="#label126">6.2.2</a>), having
the same name as the configuration file, with the suffix
<tt>.</tt><em>object</em><tt>_image</tt> appended.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
Below is a portion of a checkpoint file showing an object. Saved objects are
always represented as <tt>OBJECT</tt> <em>object-name</em> <tt>TYPE</tt>
<em>class-name</em> <tt>{</tt> <em>attributes</em> <tt>}</tt>. In this case we have
an instance of the <b>AM79C960</b> class (a 10Mbits ISA Ethernet card
with on-board DMA) named <b>lance0</b>. The <i>irq_dev</i> and the
<i>irq_level</i> attributes connect the device to a controller that will
handle the interrupts it generates. Since this device has on-board DMA, it is
also connected to memory with the <i>memory</i> attribute.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
   ...
}
OBJECT lance0 TYPE AM79C960 {
        mac_address: "10:10:10:10:10:30"
        irq_dev: isa0
        irq_level: 7
        memory: pci_mem0
        ...
}
OBJECT ... TYPE ... {
...
</pre>
<p>
Objects are saved in the main checkpoint file in no specific order.
<p>
<a name="label125"></a><h5 class="jdocu">6.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attributes</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
The short example of the <b>lance0</b> description only uses three types of
attribute values: strings, objects, and (signed 64-bit) integers. The possible attribute
types are:
<p>
<dl><dt><b>string</b></dt><dd>Strings are enclosed in double quotes, with C-style control
characters: <tt>"a string\n"</tt></dd><dt><b>integer</b></dt><dd>Integers can be in hexadecimal (<tt>0xfce2</tt>) or signed
decimal (<tt>-17</tt>) notation.</dd><dt><b>boolean</b></dt><dd>One of TRUE or FALSE.</dd><dt><b>floating-point</b></dt><dd>Specified in decimal (<tt>1.0e-2</tt>) or
hexadecimal (<tt>0x5.a21p-32</tt>) style, just like in C.</dd><dt><b>object</b></dt><dd>The name of a configuration object: <tt>cpu0</tt>.</dd><dt><b>raw data</b></dt><dd>Arbitrary data; typically used to save large dumps of
binary information. The data itself is stored in the raw data file. The syntax
is <tt>[R</tt> <em>length-in-bytes</em> <em>filename</em>
<em>file-offset</em><tt>]</tt>.</dd><dt><b>list</b></dt><dd>Comma-separated list of any attribute values, enclosed in
parentheses.  Example: <tt>("a string", 4711, (1, 2, 3), cpu0)</tt></dd><dt><b>dictionary</b></dt><dd>The format is a comma-separated list of key/value
pairs, like in: <tt>{ "master-cpu" : cpu0, "slave-cpu" : cpu1 }</tt>. The key
should be a string, integer or object, while the value can be of any attribute
type. Dictionaries are typically used to save Python dictionaries in a
checkpoint. Keys must be unique, although Simics does not enforce this.</dd></dl>
<p>
Each attribute belongs to one of the following categories. Note that only
attributes of the first two categories are saved in checkpoints.
<p>
<dl><dt><b>Required</b></dt><dd>Required attributes must be set when creating an
object. They are saved in checkpoints. If you edit a checkpoint, you should
never remove a required attribute&#8212;Simics will complain and refuse to load
the checkpoint if you do.</dd><dt><b>Optional</b></dt><dd>If no other value is provided, optional attributes take
their default value when the object is created. They are saved in checkpoints,
but if you edit them out they will revert to their default value when the
checkpoint is loaded.</dd><dt><b>Session</b></dt><dd>Session attributes are only valid during a Simics
session. They are not saved in checkpoints. They are usually used for
statistics gathering or values that can be computed from the rest of the object
state.</dd><dt><b>Pseudo</b></dt><dd>Pseudo attributes are not saved in checkpoints and usually
contain read-only information that does not change, or that is calculated when
the attribute is accessed. Pseudo attributes are in some cases used to trigger
state changes in the object when written.</dd></dl>
<p>
There are two special cases in the attribute checkpointing process. The first
one, described above, concerns raw data. Raw data is saved in a separate file
that belongs to the checkpoint file set. The main configuration file only
contains a pointer to the corresponding data in the raw data file.
<p>
The second one concerns <em>images</em>.
<p>

<a name="label126"></a><h5 class="jdocu">6.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Images</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
Simics implements a special class called <b>image</b> for objects that
potentially need to save a huge amount of state, like memories and disks. An
image represents a big amount of raw data using pages and compression to
minimize disk usage.
<p>
To save space and time, images do not save their entire state every time a
checkpoint is written. They can work in two ways:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>Images can save their state <em>incrementally</em>. At each checkpoint, an
image saves the difference between its current state and the previously saved
state (either the previous checkpoint or the initial state). This is the
default behavior implemented by Simics. This allows several checkpoints to be
saved and restored using the same base image and a series of difference
files.</li>
<p>
<li>Images can be used as <em>read-write</em> media. In that case the file
representing the data is always up to date to the current state. However, this
prevents the image from being used in a previously saved checkpoint or initial
state, since its contents are modified as the simulation advances.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
It is important to understand that when used in incremental mode, images create
<em>dependencies</em> between checkpoints. A checkpoint can only be loaded if
all previous checkpoints are intact.
<p>
To re-use the example above, let us have a look at the disk image of the same
x86 computer:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
   ...
}
OBJECT disk0_image TYPE image {
        ...
        files: (("enterprise3-rh73.craff", "ro", 0, 0x4c5abc000, 0),
                ("checkpoint-1.disk0_image", "ro", 0, 0x4c5abc000, 0))
        size: 0x4c5abc000
        ...
}
...
</pre>
<p>
The checkpointed image is based on the file
<tt>enterprise3-rh73.craff</tt>, on top of which is added the file
<tt>checkpoint-1.disk0_image</tt> that contains the difference between the
checkpoint <i>checkpoint-1</i> and the initial state.
<p>
Files like <tt>checkpoint-1.disk0_image</tt> are often called <em>diff
files</em> because they contain the difference between the new state and the
previous state.
<p>
<a name="label127"></a><h6 class="jdocu">Image Search Path</h6 class="jdocu">


<p>
<em>This section contains more in-depth explanations about image handling that
you may skip when reading this guide for the first time</em>.
<p>
When successive checkpoints are saved, an image object may become dependent on
several diff files present in different directories. To keep track of all
files, Simics stores in the checkpoint a <em>checkpoint path</em> list that
contains the absolute directory paths where image files may be found. Images
filenames are then saved as <tt>%</tt><em>n</em><tt>%/</tt><em>filename</em><tt></tt>
where <tt>%</tt><em>n</em><tt>%</tt> represents the number of the entry in the
checkpoint path, counting from zero.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Simics's checkpoint path is different from Simics's search path (see
section <a class="jdocu" href="topic74.html#label473">15.4</a>), although both will be used when looking
for image files, as show below.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
To summarize, when loading a checkpoint or a new configuration, Simics looks
for images in the following way:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>If the filename doesn't contain any path information (like
<tt>image.craff</tt>) or contains a relative path (like
<tt>test/image.craff</tt>), the file is looked up
<em>first</em> from the checkpoint directory, <em>then</em> from all
the path entries in Simics's search path, <em>in order</em> (see also
section <a class="jdocu" href="topic74.html#label473">15.4</a> for more information).
<p>
For example, if Simics's search path contains
<tt>[workspace]/targets/sunfire/</tt>
and the checkpoint is located in 
<tt>/home/joe/checkpoints/</tt>,
Simics will look for the file <tt>test/image.craff</tt>
in the following places:
<p>
<ol>
 <li><tt>/home/joe/checkpoints/test/image.craff</tt></li>
 <li><tt>[workspace]/targets/sunfire/test/image.craff</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>
</li>
<p>
<li>If the filename contains a checkpoint path marker
(<tt>%</tt><em>n</em><tt>%</tt>), the marker is translated using Simics's checkpoint
path and the file is looked up in the corresponding path.
<p>
For example, if Simics's checkpoint path contains
<tt>/home/joe/c1:/home/joe/c2</tt>, the file <tt>%1%/image.craff</tt>
will be translated into <tt>/home/joe/c2/image.craff</tt>.</li>
<p>
<li>If the filename contains an absolute path (like
<tt>/home/joe/image.craff</tt>), the file path is used as is.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> The reason why Simics's search path is involved in the process is that it
makes writing new configurations easier. Adding a path to the place where all
initial images are located allows you to just specify the image names.<hr class="jdocu_note">

<a name="label128"></a><h5 class="jdocu">6.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving and Restoring Persistent Data</h5 class="jdocu">


<a name="label129"></a>
<p>
As an alternative to checkpointing, Simics allows you to only save the
<em>persistent</em> state of a machine, i.e., data that survive when the
machine is powered-down. This typically consists of disk images and flash
memory or NVRAM contents. A persistent data checkpoint is handled exactly like
any other checkpoint and contains the same file set, but only objects
containing persistent data are saved. This persistent data checkpoint can be
loaded on top of a corresponding configuration later on.
<p>
The commands <b><a name="label130">save-persistent-state</a></b> and
<b><a name="label131">load-persistent-state</a></b> respectively save and load the
persistent data in a configuration.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> These commands are often used to save the state and reboot a machine
after the disk contents have been modified. Remember that the target OS
<b>might have cached disk contents in memory</b>. In order to have a clean disk
that can be used at boot, you should synchronize the disk, for example by
running <tt>init 0</tt> on a Unix target system, or shutting down the operating
system, before you issue the <b>save-persistent-state</b> command.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>

<a name="label132"></a><h5 class="jdocu">6.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifying Checkpoints</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
Checkpoints are usually created by saving a configuration inside Simics, but it
is possible to edit or even create checkpoints yourself.
<p>
Because a minimal checkpoint only has to include required attributes,
<em>creating a checkpoint from scratch</em> works relatively well for small
configurations. We suggest you use an existing checkpoint as a starting point
if you wish to do that. Note that more advanced layers have been built on top
of the configuration system to make the creation of a new machine much
easier. Refer to section <a class="jdocu" href="topic29.html#label148">6.5</a> for more
information.
<p>
<em>Modifying checkpoints</em> require some extra care. Adding or removing
devices may confuse the operating system, which does not expect devices to
appear or disappear while the system is running, and cause it to crash.
<p>
Changing the processor frequency may be enough to confuse the operating
system. Many operating systems check the CPU frequency at boot time, and base
their waiting loops and timing on the value they got. Saving a checkpoint and
changing the frequency after boot may affect the simulation and confuse the
system. Devices that use processor frequency to trigger events at specific
times may also behave strangely when the frequency suddenly changes.
<p>

<a name="label133"></a><h5 class="jdocu">6.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merging Checkpoints</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
If you want to make a checkpoint independent from all previous checkpoints, for
example to distribute it, you can use the small <b>checkpoint-merge</b>
program in <tt>[simics]/bin</tt> from your system command line. It
merges the checkpoint with all its ancestors to create a checkpoint that has no
dependencies.  Specify the checkpoint you want to distribute as the first
parameter and the name of the new stand-alone checkpoint as the second. This
tool can be used in both Unix and Windows environments, but it can not handle
Cygwin paths on Windows.
