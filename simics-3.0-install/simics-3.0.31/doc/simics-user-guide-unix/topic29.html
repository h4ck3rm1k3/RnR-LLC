<h4 class="jdocu">6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready-to-run Configurations</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
Simics includes many customizable ready-to-run configurations. Because
checkpoint files are by definition very static, these example configurations
are not checkpoint-based, but rather build on <em>components</em> and
<em>scripts</em> to generate a working simulated machine.
<p>
The example configurations are located in separate directories for each system
<em>architecture</em>:
<tt>[simics]/targets/</tt><em>architecture</em><tt></tt>. Each of
these directories contains a number of Simics scripts (i.e., files containing
Simics commands):
<p>
<dl><dt><b><tt>&lt;machine&gt;-common.simics</tt></b></dt><dd>Script that defines a complete simulated machine, i.e., both hardware and
software, that can be run by Simics directly.  The <tt>common</tt> script
use the <tt>-system.include</tt> script to define the hardware, and the
<tt>-setup.include</tt> script for software configuration. The
<tt>-common.simics</tt> scripts may add additional hardware in some cases.
<p>
<em>These are the files you want to use to start the standard example machines
in this directory.</em>
<p>
&lt;machine&gt; in the script name is either a Unix machine name, or a some
other name that defines the hardware/software combination.
</dd><dt><b><tt>&lt;machine&gt;-&lt;feature&gt;-common.simics</tt></b></dt><dd>A script that extends the <tt>-common.simics</tt> script with a new
feature. Many minor features, such as the processor frequency, can be
controlled using parameters to the <tt>common</tt> script, but features
that are mutually exclusive are added as separate scripts. Typical examples
are scripts that add different diff-files to the same disk image in the system
setup.</dd><dt><b>&lt;architecture-variant&gt;-system.include</b></dt><dd>Script that defines the hardware of a machine.  This script can be shared
by several simulated machines that are based on the same hardware. The hardware
setup is typically configurable using some standard parameters.
</dd><dt><b>&lt;machine&gt;-setup.include</b></dt><dd>Script that defines the software and possibly configures the machine to
run the selected software, for example setting boot path, and scripting
automatic login.
</dd></dl>
<p>
The example configurations are designed to work with the disk images
distributed by Virtutech. The machines are described in the <em>Target
Guides</em> corresponding to each architecture.
<p>
Several machines may be defined for a given architecture, and thus the
corresponding architecture directory will contain several
<tt></tt><i>machine</i><tt>-common.simics</tt> scripts.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> The <tt>[simics]/home/</tt><i>machine</i><tt></tt>
directory contains deprecated example machines provided for backward
compatibility reasons. These machine configurations are based on a
combination of Simics and Python scripts. It is highly recommended to
use the component-based scripts defined in
<tt>[simics]/targets/</tt><i>architecture</i><tt></tt>
rather than the scripts in 
<tt>[simics]/home/</tt><i>machine</i><tt></tt>.<hr class="jdocu_note">

<a name="label149"></a><h5 class="jdocu">6.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customizing the Configurations</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
There are several ways to customize the examples provided with Simics. The
table below shows them sorted by how simple they are to use.
<p>
<dl><dt><b>Parameters</b></dt><dd>The machine scripts distributed with Simics can be
modified by setting parameters (CLI variables) before the script is actually
run. This is the easiest way to change the default configuration. Parameters
can typically be used to change properties such as the amount of memory, the
number of processors and the primary MAC address. The available parameters are
listed in each <em>Target Guide</em>.  </dd><dt><b>Scripts</b></dt><dd>A simulated machine is defined by several scripts, as
described above. By replacing the <tt>-common.simics</tt> file with a user
defined one, the system can be configured in more details while keeping the
machine definition provided by the <tt>-system.include</tt> file. Similarly
the <tt>-setup.include</tt> can be replaced to configure different software
on the same machine.</dd><dt><b>Components</b></dt><dd>Components represents real hardware items such as PCI
cards, motherboards, and disks. Using components to configure a machine
provides freedom to set up the simulated machine in any way that is supported
by the architecture. The <tt>-system.include</tt> files use components to
create their machine definitions. A complete description of components is
provided earlier in this chapter.</dd><dt><b>Objects and Attributes</b></dt><dd>A component is implemented by one or more
configuration objects in Simics, and each object has several attributes
describing it. Configuring machines on the object and attribute level is
<em>not</em> supported in Simics, and such configurations may not work in
future versions.  </dd></dl>
<p>
Below is an example of a simple configuration based on
<i>ebony</i>, that uses parameters to configure two machines
slightly differently that both run in the same Simics session.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
$freq_mhz = 100
$memory_megs = 128
$host_name = "ebony0"
set-component-prefix "ebony0_"
run-command-file "ebony-linux-common.simics"

$freq_mhz = 200
$memory_megs = 256
$host_name = "ebony1"
set-component-prefix "ebony1_"
run-command-file "ebony-linux-common.simics"
</pre>
<p>

<a name="label150"></a><h5 class="jdocu">6.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding Devices to Existing Configurations</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
The parameters available for each predefined machine allows the user to do
minor modifications. It is also possible to extend the ready-to-run
configurations with additional components without creating new machine setups
from scratch. This is done by adding components and connecting them to the
machine before the <b>instantiate-components</b> command is run.
<p>
Since the machine setup scripts are located in the read-only master
installation of Simics, they should not be modified. User files that add
new components should instead be placed in the corresponding
<tt>[workspace]/targets/</tt><em>architecture</em><tt></tt> directory.
<p>
The following commands adds a SCSI controller, and one SCSI disk, to one of the
PCI slots in the predefined <tt>ebony-linux-common.simics</tt> file. The
commands should be placed in a file in the target directory for
<i>ebony</i> in the workspace, for example in
<tt>[workspace]/targets/ebony/ebony-linux-scsi.simics</tt>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
script-branch {
    wait-for-variable machine_defined
    $sym = (create-pci-sym53c810)
    $scsi_bus = (create-std-scsi-bus)
    $system.connect pci-slot2 $sym
    $scsi_bus.connect $sym
    $scsi_bus.connect (create-std-scsi-disk scsi_id = 0 size = 3221225472)
}

run-command-file "%script%/ebony-linux-common.simics"
</pre>
The script works by starting a <em>script branch</em> that waits for the CLI
variable <tt>$machine_defined</tt> to be written. All machine defining scripts
distributed with Simics sets this variable, by convention, when the complete
machine has been created but before the components are instantiated. Since
many script branches can wait for the same variable, it is possible to extend
the same configuration from different scripts in this way.
<p>
When the machine has been created, and <tt>machine_defined</tt> variable is
written, the script branch continues to execute. It creates a SCSI controller,
a SCSI bus and a 3GB disk, and then connects them. The <tt>$system</tt>
variable is defined in the <tt>ebony-system.include</tt> where the machine
is created. When the script branch has finished executing, the main script will
continue and run <tt>instantiate-components</tt>.
<p>
The example above extends the <tt>ebony-linux-common.simics</tt> file in
the workspace target directory. To access files in the target directory of the
main Simics installation, the <tt>%simics%</tt> path shortcut can be used:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
run-command-file "%simics%/targets/ebony/ebony-system.include"
</pre>
<p>
Here's another example that adds a network card in PCI slot 3 and connects it
to the same network as the primary ethernet cards:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
$create_network = yes

script-branch {
   # wait for machine to be setup and connect the new eth before instantiation
    wait-for-variable machine_defined
    $add_eth = (create-pci-dec21143 mac_address = "10:10:10:10:10:28")
    $system.connect pci-slot3 $add_eth
}
                                                     
run-command-file "%script%/ebony-linux-common.simics"                          
ethernet_link_cmp0.connect $add_eth
</pre>
