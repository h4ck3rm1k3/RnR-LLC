<p>
    The following section lists all Simics targets that are publicly available,
    i.e., available for evaluation and academic use. Not all processor models
    are available in the public distribution; contact Virtutech for information
    on other models. Refer to the Simics target guide corresponding to a
    specific target to get a full list of all the processor models available.

<p>
    This target models the Intel Itanium and Itanium2 processors. It includes
    device models to simulate a complete system based on the 460GX chipset, and
    is capable of booting <nobr>Linux 2.4</nobr>.
<p>
    <a name="label62"></a><h5 class="jdocu">3.3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malta/MIPS4kc</h5 class="jdocu">

    
<p>
    This target models the 32 bit MIPS-4Kc processor with a limited set of
    devices from the MIPS Malta reference board. Only the devices needed in
    order to boot Linux have been implemented. This targets boots Linux 2.4.
<p>
