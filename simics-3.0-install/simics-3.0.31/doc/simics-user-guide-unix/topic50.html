<p>
When using other connection types than port forwarding, Simics has to prevent
the simulated network from being flooded with packets from the real network. If
Simics buffered all incoming traffic while the simulated machine was handling
it slower than it was arriving, or while the simulation was stopped, Simics
would require arbitrarily large buffers for the incoming traffic.
<p>
This is prevented by limiting the amount of traffic that is allowed to enter
the simulated network per simulated second. The amount of traffic allowed to
enter the simulated network is determined by the <i>tx_bandwidth</i> and
<i>tx_packet_rate</i> attributes of the real network object created for
the connection, typically named <b>real_net0</b>. The unit of the
<i>tx_bandwidth</i> attribute is bits per simulated second, and the unit
of the <i>tx_packet_rate</i> attribute is packets per simulated
second. You can set either to unlimited by setting them to 0, but this is not
recommended unless you know that only a very limited amount of data will be
received. The default is to allow 10 megabits per simulated second and an
unlimited number of packets.
<p>
In addition to allowing the selected rate of traffic into the simulated
network, Simics buffers traffic for an additional 0.1 seconds simulated
time. This avoids dropping packets if there is a short peak in the traffic. If
more packets arrives once this buffer is full, Simics will drop them.
<p>
If you want to get better performance out of the connection to the real
network, you may want to alter the the <i>tx_bandwidth</i> and
<i>tx_packet_rate</i> attributes. A good strategy is to set the
<i>tx_bandwidth</i> attribute to the amount of traffic you would expect
the simulated machine to be able to handle per simulated second, and then try
to increase the <i>tx_packet_rate</i> from about 5000 and see at what
packet rate you get the best performance.
<p>
For example, this will set the limit to 100 megabits and 10000 packets per
simulated second:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>@conf.real_net0.tx_bandwidth = 100000000</b>
simics&gt; <b>@conf.real_net0.tx_packet_rate = 10000</b>
</pre>
