<p>
As an alternative to <b>gdb-remote</b>, Simics comes with
some symbolic debugging facilities of its own in the
<b>symtable</b> module. It is less full-featured than GDB
but is easy to use, and it can be scripted in Python.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Not all Simics targets have full <b>symtable</b> support
implemented. Check the reference manual for more information.  <hr class="jdocu_note">

<a name="label401"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symtables and Contexts</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
Each processor in the simulated system has a <em><a name="label402">current
context</a></em><a name="label403"></a>, which represents the
virtual address space currently visible to code running on the
processor. This context is embodied by a <b>context</b>
object. A context object has various attributes, such as
virtual-address breakpoints and symbolic information for the address
space (contained in a <b>symtable</b> object).
<p>
The correctness of the simulation does not depend on contexts in any
way; the concept of multiple virtual address spaces is useful
for <em>understanding</em> the simulated software, but not necessary
for just running it. What contexts to create and how to use them is
entirely your business; Simics does not care.
<p>
By default, each processor has the object <b>primary-context</b>
as its current context. You may create new contexts and switch between
them at any time. This allows you, for example, to maintain separate
debugging symbols and breakpoints for different processes in your
target machine. When a context is used in this manner (active when and
only when a certain simulated process is active), the context is said
to <em>follow</em><a name="label404"></a> the process.
<p>
One handy tool when trying to make a context follow a simulated process is
process trackers. A <a name="label405">process tracker</a> knows something about the target
machine and its operating system&#8212;just enough to be able to tell when a
given process is active (Simics itself knows nothing about the
abstractions&#8212;such as processes&#8212;implemented by the simulated
software). When listening to the haps triggered by the process tracker,
switching contexts at the right moment is a breeze.
<p>
Simics comes with process trackers for some targets, but far from all.
Chapter <a class="jdocu" href="topic111.html#label557">21</a> describes process
trackers in more detail, including how to build your own.
<p>
<a name="label406"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample Session</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
Here we inspect a user-space program&#8212;the
<tt><a name="label407">zsh</a></tt> shell&#8212;running on a 32-bit PowerPC
target. Two things are required for this session: a <tt>zsh</tt>
binary built with debug info (see section <a class="jdocu" href="#label414">12.3.5</a>), and its source code.
<p>
Start by creating a process tracker:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>new-linux-process-tracker kernel = ppc32-linux-2.4.17</b>
Using parameters suitable for ppc32 Linux 2.4.17.
New process tracker tracker0 created.
simics&gt; <b>tracker0.add-processor cpu0</b>
simics&gt; <b>new-context-switcher tracker = tracker0</b>
New context switcher switcher0 created.
</pre>
<p>
Note that we had to tell the process tracker which kernel we
use&#8212;or rather, what we have to tell it is the value of a number
of numerical parameters:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>tracker0.status</b>
Status of tracker0 [class linux-process-tracker]
================================================

                    Processors : cpu0
                Processor type : ppc32

Process tracking parameters:
                       ts_comm : 582
                       ts_next : 72
              ts_next_relative : 0
                        ts_pid : 128
                       ts_prev : 76
                      ts_state : 0
              ts_thread_struct : 624
</pre>
<p>
<tt>ppc32-linux-2.4.17</tt> is simply a convenient name for the set of
parameters that work with the 32-bit PowerPC Linux 2.4.17 kernel; such
predefined parameter sets exist for some of the kernels in the
machines shipped by Virtutech. If you want to do process tracking on a
kernel for which there is no such predefined parameter set, you will
want to look up the process tracker's <b>autodetect-parameters</b>
command in the Reference Manual.
<p>
We also created a <a name="label408">context switcher</a><a name="label409"></a>. It handles the rather boring task of listening to the
process tracker and actually switching contexts at the right moment,
so that one context will follow the process that runs <tt>zsh</tt>.
(Context switchers are covered in more detail in section <a class="jdocu" href="topic114.html#label570">21.3</a>.)
<p>
Now create the symbol table and load the symbols. Note that for this to
work, the <tt>zsh</tt> binary must have been built with debug info.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>new-symtable zsh_sym</b>
Created symbol table 'zsh_sym'
zsh_sym set for context primary_context
simics&gt; <b>zsh_sym.load-symbols ~/zsh-4.2.3/Src/zsh</b>
found load segment at 0x10000000
[symtable] Symbols loaded at 0x10000000
</pre>
<p>
Tell the context switcher to use a special context for the
<tt>zsh</tt> process. Make sure that the new context uses the
symbol table:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>switcher0.track-bin zsh zsh_context</b>
Context 'zsh_context' will be tracking the first process
that executes the binary 'zsh'.
simics&gt; <b>@conf.zsh_context.symtable = conf.zsh_sym</b>
</pre>
<p>
We would like to start debugging the program at the beginning of its
<tt>main</tt> function. The symbol table can tell us where that is:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>psym main</b>
{int (int, char **)} 0x100001f8
simics&gt; <b>whereis (sym main)</b>
in main() at /home/jane/zsh-4.2.3/Src/main.c:92
</pre>
<p>
<b>sym</b> is like <b>psym</b>, except that it only returns
the value, and not its type&#8212;which is exactly what other
commands are expecting as input.
<p>
Let us set a breakpoint at <tt>main</tt>, and let the simulation run:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>zsh_context.break -x (sym main)</b>
Breakpoint 1 set on address 0x100001f8 with access mode 'x'
1
simics&gt; <b>c</b>
</pre>
<p>
Note that as long as you do not execute a binary named "<tt>zsh</tt>",
you can
run whatever program you want without triggering this breakpoint. That
is because it is set on the <b>zsh_context</b> context, which will
not be activated until <tt>zsh</tt> is run:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
$ <b>ls /</b>
bin   dev  home  lib         mnt  proc  sbin  usr
boot  etc  host  lost+found  opt  root  tmp   var
$ <b>sh -c 'echo foo'</b>
foo
$ <b>zsh</b>
</pre>
<p>
Now the simulation stops:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
Code breakpoint 1 reached.
main (argc=0, argv=0x0) at /home/jane/zsh-4.2.3/Src/main.c:92
92      {
[cpu0] v:0x100001f8 p:0x079d41f8  stwu r1,-32(r1)
</pre>
<p>
We can single-step through the code:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>zsh_context.step</b>

93          return (zsh_main(argc, argv));
simics&gt;

zsh_main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffe14) at /home/jane/zsh-4.2.3/Src/init.c:1205
1205    {
simics&gt;

1206        char **t;
simics&gt;

1209        setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
simics&gt;

1212        init_jobs(argv, environ);
simics&gt;

init_jobs (argv=0x1, envp=0x7ffffe14) at /home/jane/zsh-4.2.3/Src/jobs.c:1465
1465    {
</pre>
<p>
(Just pressing Return at the prompt repeats the last stepping
command.)
<p>
Note how the function <tt>setlocale</tt> was skipped. It is part of
the C library linked into <tt>zsh</tt>, which was not compiled with
line number information.
<p>
We can also examine the contents of variables (note that some C
expressions must be quoted to prevent the command-line parser from
trying to parse them):
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>psym envp</b>
(char **) 0x7ffffe14
simics&gt; <b>psym "envp[0]"</b>
(char *) 0x7ffffefa "zsh"
</pre>
<p>
Looking at the stack, we can see that we have made two function calls
that have not returned since we started single-stepping:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>stack-trace</b>
#0 0x10043914 in init_jobs (argv=0x1, envp=0x7ffffe14)

</pre>
<p>
<a name="label410"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source Code Stepping</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
There are other source code stepping functions besides
<b>step</b>. <b>next</b>, for example, steps to the next
source line without descending into function calls like
<b>step</b> does. (This is exactly what happened when
<b>step</b> skipped <tt>setlocale</tt>, but <b>next</b> will
do this with every function call whether or not we have line number
information for them.) And <b>finish</b> runs the simulation until
the current function returns:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>zsh_context.finish</b>

zsh_main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffe14) at /home/jane/zsh-4.2.3/Src/init.c:1219
1219        typtab['\0'] |= IMETA;
</pre>
<p>
If Hindsight is enabled, all these stepping commands have reverse
counterparts: <b>rstep</b>, <b>rnext</b>, and
<b>uncall</b>.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> The stepping commands expect to step through a single
single-threaded process. If the context does not properly follow a
single process, or if that process is multi-threaded, they may
terminate too soon, or too late, or not at all.
<p>
The reason for this is that all but the simplest stepping commands
rely on the stack pointer to be well-behaved &#8211; in particular,
that it keeps pointing to the same stack. The presence of multiple
threads &#8211; or multiple processes not hidden by a process tracker
&#8211; breaks this assumption.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
<a name="label411"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symbolic Breakpoints</h5 class="jdocu">


<a name="label412"></a>
<p>
We saw earlier how <b>sym</b> could be used to set a breakpoint on
a function. <b>pos</b> can be used to set a breakpoint on a source
line:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>pos jobs.c:1465</b>
268712212
simics&gt; <b>hex (pos jobs.c:1465)</b>
0x10043914
simics&gt; <b>zsh_context.break -x (pos jobs.c:1465)</b>
Breakpoint 26 set on address 0x10043914 with access mode 'x'
26
</pre>
<p>
It is also possible to set a breakpoint on data (a
<a name="label413">watchpoint</a>). The following example sets a data breakpoint
on the variable "<tt>argc</tt>", causing the simulation to stop
whenever this
variable is read from or written to. The second parameter is the
extent of the breakpoint, in bytes.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>zsh_context.break -r -w (sym "&amp;argc") (sym "sizeof argc")</b>
Breakpoint 27 set on address 0x7ffffd88, length 4 with access mode 'rw'
27
</pre>
<p>
See section <a class="jdocu" href="topic59.html#label352">12.1</a> for more information about how
to use breakpoints.

<a name="label414"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading Debug Information from Binaries</h5 class="jdocu">


<a name="label415"></a>
<a name="label416"></a>
<p>
Symbolic information is normally read from file using the <b>&lt;symtable&gt;.load-symbols</b> command as in the example above.
Currently only <a name="label417">ELF</a> binaries can be used, and the debug info
must be in the <a name="label418">STABS</a> format. Also, the files must
be present on the host machine&#8212;Simics cannot read directly
from the file system of the simulated machine.
<p>
Here are some things to think about when preparing a binary for debugging:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
  <li>On some platforms, the <a name="label419">GCC</a> compiler does not use the
  <a name="label420">STABS</a> format by default. Use the <tt>-gstabs+</tt> option
  to force STABS (with some GCC extensions) to be used.</li>
<p>
  <li>Some versions of the Sun WorkShop<a name="label421"></a> (Forte<a name="label422"></a>) C compiler do not
  put the debug information in the final executable, but expect a
  debugger to read it from the object files directly. This is not
  supported by Simics, so be sure to use the <tt>-xs</tt> option when
  compiling.</li>
<p>
  <li>If getting sensible stack traces is important, adhere to the
  target machine's calling and stack frame conventions. In other
  words, avoid optimizations such as GCC's
  <tt>-fomit-frame-pointer</tt>.</li>
<p>
  <li>Currently, only C is supported, not C++. It is possible to debug
  programs built from a mixture of C and C++ source, but then only
  symbols from the C part (and those declared <tt>extern "C"</tt>)
  will be reliably recognized, for name mangling reasons.</li>
<p>
  <li>It is possible to debug dynamically loaded code by specifying
  the base address of each module when using <b>load-symbols</b>,
  but it is easier to just link the code statically when possible. See
  section <a class="jdocu" href="topic60.html#label388">12.2.1</a> for how to
  find the base address on some systems.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="label423"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loading Symbols from Alternate Sources</h5 class="jdocu">


<a name="label424"></a>
<p>
Sometimes it is desirable to read symbols from a source other than a
binary file&#8212;perhaps all you have is a text file listing the symbols.
The <b>&lt;symtable&gt;.<a name="label425">plain-symbols</a></b> command reads
symbols from a file in the output format of the BSD <b>nm</b>
command. <a name="label426"></a> Example:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
000000000046b7e0 T iunique
000000000062ba40 B ivector_table
00000000005a6338 D jiffies
</pre>
<p>
The hexadecimal number is the symbol value, usually the address. The letter
is a type code; for this purpose, D, B, and R are treated as data and anything
else as code.
<p>
The symbols do not have any C type or line number information associated with
them, but you will at least be able to print stack traces and find the location of
statically allocated variables.
<p>
<a name="label427"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple Debugging Contexts</h5 class="jdocu">


<a name="label428"></a>
<p>
The process tracker and context switcher can without problem handle
separate contexts (and symbol tables) for two or more processes at once:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>new-symtable encode_sym</b>
Created symbol table 'encode_sym'
encode_sym set for context primary_context
simics&gt; <b>encode_sym.load-symbols ~/sharutils-4.3.80/src/uuencode</b>
[symtable] Symbols loaded at 0x10000000
simics&gt; <b>switcher0.track-bin uuencode context = encode_context</b>
Context 'encode_context' will be tracking the first process
that executes the binary 'uuencode'.
simics&gt; <b>@conf.encode_context.symtable = conf.encode_sym</b>
</pre>
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>new-symtable decode_sym</b>
Created symbol table 'decode_sym'
simics&gt; <b>decode_sym.load-symbols ~/sharutils-4.3.80/src/uudecode</b>
[symtable] Symbols loaded at 0x10000000
simics&gt; <b>switcher0.track-bin uudecode context = decode_context</b>
Context 'decode_context' will be tracking the first process
that executes the binary 'uudecode'.
simics&gt; <b>@conf.decode_context.symtable = conf.decode_sym</b>
</pre>
<p>
Here, we have created separate contexts for the programs
<tt>uuencode</tt> and <tt>uudecode</tt>, loaded their symbols into two
<b>symtable</b>s, and asked the context switcher to associate
these contexts
with the first processes that execute "<tt>uuencode</tt>" and
"<tt>uudecode</tt>", respectively.
<p>
We would like to step through <tt>uudecode</tt> first:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>decode_context.step</b>
</pre>
<p>
The simulation just runs freely now, waiting for us to reach a source
line while <b>decode_context</b> is active&#8212;which will
happen as soon as we start <tt>uudecode</tt>:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
$ <b>ls -laR / | uuencode - | uudecode | wc</b>
</pre>
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
main (argc=0, argv=0x0) at /home/jane/sharutils-4.3.80/src/uudecode.c:432
432     {
</pre>
<p>
We started four programs at once, here. First, <tt>ls</tt> prints a
listing of every file on the target machine. This listing is fed to
<tt>uuencode</tt>, which encodes it, then feeds the coded result to
<tt>uudecode</tt>, which decodes it. The decoded file listing (which
is identical to the original listing produced by <tt>ls</tt>) is then
fed to <tt>wc</tt>, which counts the number of words in it and prints
the result on the terminal.
<p>
This description makes it sound like the four programs are run in
sequence, one after the other. This is not the case. They all run
simultaneously&#8212;or rather, since this is a single-processor
system, they run interleaved. It works more or less like this:
<p>
<ol>
<p>
  <li><tt>ls</tt> runs, accumulating output in a buffer. When that
  buffer is full, it makes a system call that passes the buffered
  output to the next process, <tt>uuencode</tt>.</li>
<p>
  <li><tt>uuencode</tt> runs until it has consumed all available
  input, or until it has to flush its output buffer.</li>
<p>
  <li><tt>uudecode</tt> runs until it has consumed all available
  input, or until it has to flush its output buffer.</li>
<p>
  <li><tt>wc</tt> runs until it has consumed all available input.</li>
<p>
  <li>Repeat until <tt>wc</tt> has finished.</li>
<p>
</ol>
<p>
Things may not happen in exactly that order; the only constraint is
that a process that is waiting for input cannot be run until some
input is available. As long as the amount of data to be passed is
large enough to fill the programs' output buffers several times over
(and a directory listing of the entire file system should be large
enough), execution will alternate between the different programs. So,
when we reach the first source line in <tt>uudecode</tt>,
<tt>uuencode</tt> should still be running.
<p>
Let's first step a few lines in <tt>uudecode</tt>:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>decode_context.step</b>

433       int opt;
simics&gt;

437       program_name = argv[0];
</pre>
<p>
This is just like when we were debugging a single program. Now, let's
test our assumption by stepping to the next line in <tt>uuencode</tt>.
The step command will let the simulation run until we reach a new line
<em>in that context</em>, so we will either stop when
<tt>uuencode</tt> gets to run again, or continue running forever if
<tt>uuencode</tt> has already finished.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>encode_context.step</b>

try_putchar (c=34) at /home/jane/sharutils-4.3.80/src/uuencode.c:130
130       if (putchar (c) == EOF)
</pre>
<p>
As expected, <tt>uuencode</tt> was still running. In fact, it was busy
outputting text for <tt>uudecode</tt> when it was interrupted so that
<tt>uudecode</tt> could be started.
<p>
If we step to the next line in <tt>uudecode</tt> again, we see that it
has now run to the point where it was blocking, waiting for
<tt>uuencode</tt> to produce more output:
<p>

It is often useful to access data symbolically from <a name="label431">Python</a>
scripts. Scripts access the debugging facilities using the
<tt>symtable</tt> interface and attributes of the
<b>symtable</b> class. These are documented in the <em>Simics
Reference Manual</em>.
<p>
For instance, here is a short script to print out the contents of one

<tt>zsh</tt> uses these lists for lots of things, among them to store
the directory stack. After having given the command <tt>pushd</tt> a
few times on the <tt>zsh</tt> prompt, we can inspect the directory
stack by stopping in the <tt>bin_cd</tt> function and printing the
linked list "<tt>dirstack</tt>":
