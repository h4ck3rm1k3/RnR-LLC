<p>
Virtually tagged caches are usually informed of the state of the MMU in order
to immediately invalidate lines whose virtual-to-physical mapping
changes. <b>g-cache</b> is not MMU-aware, so when looking for a hit
with virtual tags, it tries to match both the virtual tag and the physical tag.
This approach prevents cache accesses from triggering a hit on lines with
invalid translations, but it makes it possible for some invalid mappings to be
present in the cache (and shown by the <b>status</b> command for example).
<p>
Some special instructions (atomic instructions in particular) can cause the STC
counters to be off by about one memory access per million, which
influences the total number of transactions reported by the cache.
The UltraSPARC architecture should be free of this bug, while others may
still trigger it in some circumstances. The workaround is to avoid using
the STC if a very precise total transaction count is needed.
<p>
<b>g-cache</b> doesn't understand control transactions like cache
flushes and cache line locking.
