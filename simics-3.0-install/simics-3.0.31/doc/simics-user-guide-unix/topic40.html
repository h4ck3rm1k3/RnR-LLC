<p>
Connecting simulated machines over a simulated <a name="label258">Ethernet</a>
connection is done by creating an <b>ethernet-link</b> object
that connects to the Ethernet devices in the machines.  The link
object can be thought of as modeling an Ethernet cable that is plugged
in to the connectors on the devices.
<p>
The <a name="label259">link object</a> models Ethernet at the frame level, in that
it performs delivery of complete frames sent from one device to any
other device connected to the link, and doesn't model collisions or
lower-level signaling details.  This means that it can be used either
to model point-to-point twisted-pair or fiber cables running at any
speed, or even a 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 traditional coaxial bus, without
any changes to the model.  Another way of viewing
<b>ethernet-link</b> is to see it as an Ethernet hub or switch
to which can be connected two or more devices.
<p>
Traffic sent over the link can be anything, including
<a name="label260">TCP/IP</a> or any other protocol stack that works on top of
Ethernet.  The link object doesn't need to be configured with any
information about how it will be used.
<p>
New <b>ethernet-link</b> objects can be added with the
<b>new-ethernet-link</b> command:
