<p>
  Solaris can be installed directly on the simulated machine in Simics.
  Solaris can be obtained from Sun's web-site at
  <a class="jdocu" href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/binaries/get.html" target="_top">http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/binaries/get.html</a> in the
  form of ISO images.
<p>
  To simplify the installation process, some scripts are supplied with the
  Simics distribution for the abisko machine:
  <tt>abisko-sol&lt;version&gt;-cd-install1.simics</tt>,  
  <tt>abisko-sol&lt;version&gt;-cd-install2.simics</tt> and
  <tt>abisko-sol&lt;version&gt;-cd-install3.simics</tt>,
  where &lt;version&gt; is <tt>8</tt>, <tt>9</tt> or <tt>10</tt>.  The scripts
  will answer all questions automatically to create a standard workstation
  install.

  This section describes how to install Solaris using the command-line
  version Simics.
  <ol>
<p>
  <li>
  Select the install script to use, depeding on Solaris version to install,
  either <tt>abisko-sol10-cd-install1.simics</tt>
  for Solaris 10, <tt>abisko-sol9-cd-install1.simics</tt>
  for Solaris 9, or <tt>abisko-sol8-cd-install1.simics</tt>
  for Solaris 8. 
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  Set the path to the CD image in the simics script. The line
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    $cdrom_path = "sol-10-u2-ga-sparc-v1.iso"
</pre>
  should be changed to reflect the location and name of the CD image
  for stage one of the installlation. It can either be an ISO image file, or
  a CD-ROM device file (Linux and Solaris host only).
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  Start the first installation script, for example:
  <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  $ <b>./simics targets/serengeti/abisko-sol10-cd-install1.simics</b>
  </pre>
  and wait for it to complete. This may take several hours, depending on the
  performance of the host machine. 
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  When the script stops, installation from the first CD is finished, and
  Solaris has tried to reboot the system. Since Simics does not support system
  reboot for this architecture, exit Simics at this point.
<p>
  If the installation is performed from a real CD, it is now time to change
  disc in the drive. Also make sure that the path to the CD is correct in the
  second install script.
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  Now run the second script in the same way as the first, this script may also
  take a few hours to complete.
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  When the second script has stopped, run the third and last one. This script
  only takes a few minutes to finish.
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  When the third script has stopped the installation is ready. The newly
  created disk image has the following file name:
  <tt>abisko-sol&lt;version&gt;-install.disk</tt>. There are also
  a number of <em>persistent state</em> files.
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  To boot a machine with the newly installed Solaris OS, run the
  <tt>abisko-common.simics</tt> and make sure that the variable
  <tt>$os</tt> is set to <tt>"solaris10"</tt>,
  <tt>"solaris9"</tt> or <tt>"solaris8"</tt> depending on
  the operating system version installed). Add a line like the following first
  in that simics script:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  $os = "solaris10"
</pre>
  </li>
<p>
  <li>
  An optional last step is to compress the disk image with the
  <tt>craff</tt> utility to save some disk space.
  </li>
<p>
  </ol>
