<p>
   The ability to checkpoint and restore the state of a system is
   crucial to Simics functionality. Your device model should support
   checkpointing. In particular, you should ensure that:
   <ul>
   <li>All relevant state can be accessed as attributes</li>
   <li>The device can have its entire relevant state restored by writing
       to those attributes</li>
   <li>That an attribute can be written to any number of times while the
       device is active, and not assume that only a single
       initialization will be performed (to support the quick
       checkpoints of Simics Hindsight)</li>
   </ul>
<p>
   Attributes containing information which is set when a configuration
   is first loaded, have historically been coded as not being
   dynamically settable (as changing such information on the fly could
   compromise the stability and consistency of the simulation). Their
   contents are supposed to maintain the same value over the entire life
   of a Simics process; thus, updating them does not make sense. In
   order to support Simics Hindsight, however, it is necessary to make
   these attributes settable. The solution is to check that the value
   being set is the same as the previous value (i.e., the one set upon
   initialization), and if not, report an error.
<p>
   Furthermore, device models often cache parts of their state
   internally for the sake of speed, rather than keeping it accessible
   via attributes. To ensure correct behavior, e.g. when reversing to a
   micro-checkpoint, all internal caches have to be cleared when an
   attribute is set.
<p>
   In the case that a module lacks any attributes that can be used to
   indicate flushing of the state, there is a special interface
   <tt>temporal_state_interface_t</tt> available that lets a module get
   callbacks when the state is being reset for Hindsight
   micro-checkpoints. This is however very rarely needed.
