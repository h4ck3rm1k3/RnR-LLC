<p>
   There are three main <a name="label27">goals</a> when writing a device for
   Simics: accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity.
<p>
   <a name="label28"></a>Every device should be <i>accurate</i> enough
   that the software that executes within Simics does not notice that
   it is running in a simulator rather than on real hardware.  Note
   that the accuracy is thus defined relative to some particular piece
   of software: the device is accurate enough if the given software
   cannot tell the difference between the model and reality.
<p>
   <a name="label29"></a>We want our simulations to run as fast as
   possible.  Devices that are used frequently should therefore be as
   <i>efficient</i> as possible. General programming
   principles of course apply, but it is even more important to understand
   how the device is being accessed during simulation, in order to optimize
   its performance.
<p>
   <a name="label30"></a><i>Simplicity</i> is always an important goal
   in software development, since it leads to reduced development
   time, reduced bug count, and easier debugging.  Device modeling is
   no exception to this rule.  Often, simplicity and efficiency go
   hand in hand, so that a simpler device model is also faster.
<p>
   <a name="label31"></a>There is a conflict between the accuracy and
   efficiency goals: more accuracy typically leads to reduced
   efficiency.  To maximize this trade-off, one should strive to model
   as little as possible of the real behavior of the device.  The process
   of simplifying the behavior of the device in the model compared to the
   real world is called <i>abstraction</i>.  Later sections
   will show different kinds of abstraction that can be used to make
   your device model both simpler and more efficient.
   In order to know how much abstraction is permissible, it is
   essential to look at the behavior of the particular software that
   will access the device, typically a device driver in the operating system.
<p>
   Of course, there are situations where additional requirements
   affect the level of detail in your model.  For most models it is only
   necessary that the software runs correctly on top of them, but the models are not of
   further interest in themselves.  However, if you for example want to
   study disk accesses, you may need to build a more detailed model of
   the disks than you would in order to simply run a system that contains a disk.
