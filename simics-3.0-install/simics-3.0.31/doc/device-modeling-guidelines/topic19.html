   <a name="label61"></a>How do you test a completed model to see if it is
   accurate and efficient enough?  Basically, you try to find software
   that stresses the device as much as possible.  Try different
   OS/driver combinations (if this is a requirement).  Find programs
   on top of the OS that exercise the device in different ways.
   Perhaps there are diagnostic programs that verify that the device
   functions correctly.  It is a good idea to run the programs on real
   hardware first, to make sure the software is functional, before
   trying them on the virtual hardware.
<p>
   Run the selected programs in Simics, with the device model in
   place, and look for signs of trouble.  Such signs may be
<p>
   <ol>
   <li>The device reports accesses to unimplemented features.  These
   will need to be modeled.</li>
<p>
   <li>The program, OS, or simulated machine behaves strangely,
   indicating flaws in the device model's functional behavior.</li>
<p>
   <li>Simulation performance is poor.  The model needs to be made
   more efficient.</li>
   </ol>
<p>
   It is also a good idea to sometimes let the tests run for a longer
   time. This allows you to spot problems with, e.g., memory leaks in
   the model implementation, or diagnose situations where the driver
   has entered some fall-back mode after seeing too many errors.  The
   <tt>VTMEM</tt> package can help in diagnosing memory-related
   problems (see the <em>Simics Reference Manual</em> for
   details).
