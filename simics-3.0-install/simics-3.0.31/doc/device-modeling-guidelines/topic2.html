Simics comes with several guides and manuals, which will be briefly described
here. All documentation can be found in <tt>[simics]/doc</tt> as Windows
Help files (on Windows), HTML files (on Unix) and PDF files (on both
platforms). The new Eclipse-based interface also includes Simics documentation
in its own help system.
