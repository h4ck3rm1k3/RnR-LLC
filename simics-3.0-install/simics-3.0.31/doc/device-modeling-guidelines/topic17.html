<p>
   If the device performs a series of small related events, it is
   desirable to cluster these events into larger chunks, even if the
   simulator cannot respond immediately.  For example, in a DMA
   transfer, rather than moving a few bytes every single cycle, the
   simulated device can move a whole memory page at a time every N
   cycles, where N is adapted to give the same overall transfer rate.
   Again, this means the model is invoked fewer times, and furthermore
   it will trigger other devices less often, too.
