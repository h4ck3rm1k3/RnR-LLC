<p>
   Abstracting the hardware-software interface is more tricky, since
   the simulator does not control the software the same way it
   controls the hardware.  <a name="label41"></a>However, since the device
   accuracy is defined relative to the driver software that accesses
   it, there are quite a few things that can be done once the driver
   and the usage pattern is known.
<p>
   The obvious thing to do is to abstract away all parts of the
   interface that are never accessed by the driver.  Control registers
   not used by the driver, states that are never entered, and
   behaviors that are never triggered can well be left unimplemented.
   For debugging reasons one should make sure to indicate to the user
   whenever accesses to unimplemented parts of the model occur.  See
   section <a class="jdocu" href="topic23.html#label69">9.3</a> for more on error reporting and user
   interface issues.
<p>
   Another area where the hardware-software interface can be
   abstracted is timing.  This is covered in more detail in section
   <a class="jdocu" href="topic15.html#label49">7</a>.
