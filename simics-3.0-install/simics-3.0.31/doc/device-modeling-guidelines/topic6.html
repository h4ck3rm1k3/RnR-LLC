<p>
   The defining difference between full-system simulation and
   traditional instruction set simulation is the modeling of
   devices. Device models are necessary in order to get meaningful
   software to run on the simulator: timers, network interfaces, PCI
   bridges, SCSI interfaces, graphics devices, serial ports - there is
   a large number of different devices in a computer system that are
   visible to the software, and therefore need to be modeled.
<p>
   Device models can be either transaction-oriented or bit-level. A
   transaction-oriented model handles each interaction (typically, a
   read or write access to the interface registers of a device)
   as an atomic operation: the device is presented with a
   request, computes the reply, and returns it in a single function
   call. This synchronous model is very efficient.
<p>
   A bit-level model instead models the actual bit patterns traveling
   over buses and pins in the computer. Instead of a synchronous
   transaction, each phase of a transaction is played out as a
   unidirectional message. The device model will read the address and
   data lines, wait for some cycles, and then put its reply on the bus
   connecting it to the CPU. This is an asynchronous style that
   results in much lower performance, since the simulation needs to
   switch contexts more often.
<p>
   Of course, it is possible to create hybrids between the two
   extremes described above.
   One quite common approach is to let most of a system work at the
   transaction level, modeling only a small part of the system at the
   asynchronous bit-level.  This offers an efficient way to drive a
   detailed model of a device with real traffic from a full system.
<p>
   Most of the guidelines in this document assume that a (mainly)
   transaction-oriented device model is being developed.
