<p>
   The device model is typically expected to be accurate under normal
   working conditions.  Error states (those that do not occur under
   normal conditions) should never be entered.  Most errors are
   hardware induced; e.g., parity errors, failure to read firmware ROM
   data, etc.  These will never occur in Simics, because the virtual
   hardware is controlled by the simulator.  The device model is
   simplified by not having to represent the error states.
<p>
   Sometimes, though, the errors are the interesting parts of the
   model.  If the model is to be used in developing the error handling
   in a device driver, the error states need to be modeled in more
   detail (and some means of triggering the errors must be added).
   Fault-injection in simulated networks is another example.
