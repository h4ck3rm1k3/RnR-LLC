<p>
   To increase the performance of your model, you should optimize for
   the common case, even if it means that some uncommon cases become
   much slower.  Also, it is usually more important to reduce <em>how
   often</em> the device model is invoked, than reducing the time spent in
   each invocation.
<p>
   The simulator framework can help you avoid unnecessary
   model invocations.  For example, rather than having the device
   model poll a memory location repeatedly, you can set a breakpoint
   which is triggered only when the value at that location changes.
