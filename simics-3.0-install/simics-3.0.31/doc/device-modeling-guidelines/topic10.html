<p>
   A Simics device model should be transparent to the software, so
   that the software does not notice the difference between the model
   and the real device.  This sets the basic level of detail for the
   model: anything that is not visible to the software (directly or
   indirectly) may be ignored (if not of interest for other
   reasons). It is not necessary to model things like the current
   status of the signals at the interface pins, hidden internal
   hardware registers, etc., unless these can be accessed by the
   software.  The model provides the functional behavior of the
   device as seen by the software.
<p>
   <a name="label38"></a> Since Simics
   usually controls both parties in any transactions at the hardware
   level, hardware-hardware interfaces can usually be heavily
   simplified.  For example, transactions on a memory bus or device
   interconnect are usually modeled as atomic, rather than composed of
   individual steps where buses are arbitrated, addresses written,
   data read, etc.
<p>
   Another example is the standard Simics cache model: the caches hold
   no data, they just keep track of what items are in the cache, and
   inform the CPU model of the delay associated with each memory
   access.  The actual data is acquired from the model of main memory,
   regardless of what cache level the item was found in.
<p>
   For network interfaces, the device models can often abstract away
   internal buffers that store data during transmission or reception:
   each packet is sent immediately upon request, and other parts of
   the simulation make sure it is received with the proper delay.
<p>
   Frequently repeated actions should be avoided in all device models.
   In the network case, the hardware-level protocols should as far as
   possible abstract away things like idle-traffic (packets sent to
   ascertain that the link and/or particular devices are still there).
   This is usually OK, since the simulator controls both the link and
   the devices connected to it, and can check by other means that they
   are still alive.
<p>
   Sometimes there are requirements on what state should be
   inspectable in the device model, which can affect the level of
   detail.  For example, most memory systems have a number of small
   internal buffers that are used for temporary storage during memory
   transactions.  If these are to be available for inspection, they
   must be modeled somehow.  Sometimes it may be necessary to provide
   two models with different levels of detail, allowing the user to
   select the appropriate trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.
<p>
   Performance-critical transactions between devices can sometimes be
   abstracted away by merging the devices into a single model.  As an
   example, consider a large low-latency token ring network,
   represented as one device model per node.  Simulating the message
   transfer as individual hops around the ring will require a lot of
   expensive network synchronization for the processes involved, which
   will make the simulation run slowly.  Increasing the latency on the
   links speeds up the simulation, but slows down the simulated
   network instead, which could break the protocols because of
   timeouts.  If the accuracy requirements permit, the performance of
   such a system can be greatly improved by modeling it at a much
   more abstract level: The ring is treated as a single device, which
   means the forwarding of messages around the ring can be ignored,
   allowing the model to route packages directly to the intended
   receiver instead.
