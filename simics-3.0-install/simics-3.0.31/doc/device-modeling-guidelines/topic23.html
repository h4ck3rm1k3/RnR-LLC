<p>
   The model should handle errors in a forgiving way.  Avoid crashing
   or triggering assertions; instead, log an error message and try to
   continue anyway.  If necessary, halt the simulator, but allow the
   user to continue manually.
<p>
   There are three different kinds of errors that should be reported
   by a Simics device:
<p>
   <ol>
   <li><a name="label71"></a><i>Outside architecture</i>
       error.  A part of the device whose behavior is not specified
       in the hardware documentation has been accessed.  For example,
       a reserved register has been written to.</li>
<p>
   <li><a name="label72"></a><i>Unimplemented</i> error.  A
       part of the device which has been left unimplemented in the
       model (abstracted away) was accessed.  This suggests a bug in
       the model, or that the model is used with software it was not
       developed for.
<p>
       <a name="label73"></a> In some cases it is sufficient to give
       a warning for this kind of situation, for example if the model
       returns approximate or invented values.</li>
<p>
   <li><a name="label74"></a><i>Internal</i> error.  The internal
       state of the model implementation has been corrupted beyond
       repair.  Look for "this will never happen" comments and
       reconsider...</li>
   </ol>
<p>
   Simics has extensive support for <a name="label75">logging</a>, allowing you
   to assign the output to different message categories, and different
   levels of verbosity. See the <em>DML Reference Manual</em> and
   the <em>Simics Reference Manual</em> for details.
   Logging is mostly used during development and debugging of the
   model, but is also useful to aid inspection of the device state
   during actual simulation.
<p>
   Always use detailed error messages.  Often, the error messages are
   the only source of information when a bug is reported by
   another user.  It is not certain that the execution can be repeated, or
   that the developer will have access to the same setup.
