<p>
   The typical development <a name="label34">methodology</a> can be summed up in
   the phrase <i>the device model is the inverse of the
   <a name="label35">driver</a></i>.  In short, it works as follows: Starting
   with a skeleton model, boot up the driver in Simics and use the
   inspection facilities to see what device registers it accesses
   first.  Model those, and if necessary the subsystem behind them,
   using the hardware documentation for reference. With the additions
   in place, run the driver again to find the next part of the device
   that needs modeling.  This is repeated until no more
   unaccounted-for references are found, at which time the device is
   declared finished. 
<p>
   The skeleton model needs to be detailed enough to allow logging of
   the activities of the driver with respect to the device.  For
   example, all interface registers may be modeled, but their
   semantics may be left unimplemented.
<p>
   Running the software will also help the developer understand what
   modes of functioning will or will not be used in the device model,
   such as commands or setup options that are never used.
<p>
   If the hardware documentation is not available, it is often
   possible to use a well documented open source device driver for
   reference when implementing the semantics of the device.

   models during development.
