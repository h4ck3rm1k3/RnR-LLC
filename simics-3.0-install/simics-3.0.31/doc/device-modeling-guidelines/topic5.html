<p>
   Simics is a full-system simulator.  Its purpose is to replace real
   hardware in testing, development, research, etc.  In order to be
   useful, Simics must be able to run realistic workloads.  This
   requires a careful balancing of accuracy and efficiency.
<p>
   Technically, Simics can be classified as an event-driven simulator.
   It models the world as a series
   of disjoint events, where each event occurs at some specific time.
   Events can query and modify the simulated state, and post new
   events.  This approach is very efficient, since the simulator does
   nothing at all when there are no events, and can be made
   arbitrarily accurate.  The alternative, clock-driven simulation,
   can never be made as fast.
<p>
   Simics simulates a CPU at the instruction set level, the lowest
   level that is readily visible to software.  This lets it run
   unmodified binary code for the complete software stack of a system.
   To make this work, the simulator provides bit-exact functional
   accuracy at this level.  Somewhat less accuracy is normally
   provided in the time domain.  However, time accuracy can be
   selectively improved if needed, at the cost of sacrificing some
   efficiency.
