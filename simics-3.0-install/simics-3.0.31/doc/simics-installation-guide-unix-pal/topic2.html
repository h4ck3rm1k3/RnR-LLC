<h2 class="jdocu">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing Simics</h2 class="jdocu">


<p>
Simics is provided as a <tt>tar</tt> archive file called
<tt>simics-pal-3.0.0-linux.tar</tt> where 3.0.0 is the Simics version
number. It is recommended that Simics is installed by <tt>root</tt> in a
read-only location, such as <tt>/opt/virtutech/</tt>. Once Simics is
installed, a Simics workspace can be setup, as described in section
<a class="jdocu" href="topic3.html#label26">4</a>.
<p>
Although Simics for PAL (Personal Academic License) users is a single user
product, it is recommended that the workspace with user files is kept separate
from the base Simics installation.

<a name="label21"></a><h3 class="jdocu">Installing a Simics Package</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Download the Simics package from the download site.</li>
<p>
<li>Unpack the Simics package by running <tt>tar</tt>.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
$ <b>tar xf simics-pal-3.0.0-linux.tar</b>
</pre>
This will create a temporary installation directory called
<tt>simics-3.0-install</tt>.
</li>
<p>
<li>Change to the temporary installation directory and run the install script.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
$ <b>su</b>
Password:
# <b>cd simics-3.0-install</b>
# <b>sh install-simics.sh</b>
</pre>
</li>
<p>
<li>The install script will search the current directory for packages to
install and ask for an alternative directory to install Simics in instead of
the default one.</li>
<p>
<li>When the install script finishes, Simics has been installed in
<tt>/opt/virtutech/simics-&lt;version&gt;/</tt>. This path is referred to as
<tt>[simics]</tt> in all Simics documentation. The <tt>/opt/virtutech/</tt>
path may differ if an alternative installation directory was specified when the
install script was run.</li>
<p>
<li>The temporary installation directory may be removed when Simics has been
successfully installed.</li>
<p>
</ol>
<p>

<a name="label22"></a><h3 class="jdocu">Installing the License</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
Copy the license file, that you should have received by email, to
<tt>[simics]/licenses</tt>:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
# <b>cp simics-license-<em>hostid</em>.lic /opt/virtutech/simics-&lt;version&gt;/licenses/</b>
</pre>
<p>

<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Once FLEXlm has successfully checked out a license it will add the path
to the license search path (if it is not already present) in the
<tt>.flexlmrc</tt> file in the user's home directory. If it takes a long
time when Simics checks out the license, check this file for old incorrect
paths to remove.

<a name="label23"></a><h3 class="jdocu">Installing Disk Images</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
A disk image, also called <em>disk dump</em> represents the contents of a hard
disk, usually in a compressed form. Since images can be quite big, they are
not provided in the standard Simics packages, but have to be downloaded
separately. Publicly available image files can be downloaded from the Simics
web site, <a class="jdocu" href="https://www.simics.net/" target="_top">https://www.simics.net/</a>.
<p>

<a name="label24"></a><h4 class="jdocu">3.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single User Environment</h4 class="jdocu">


In single user environments it is usually easiest to keep image files in
the corresponding <tt>[workspace]/targets/&lt;architecture&gt;/</tt> directory.
Simics will automatically look for files in this directory, and images do not
have to be moved when Simics is upgraded.

<a name="label25"></a><h4 class="jdocu">3.0.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi User Environment</h4 class="jdocu">


To allow several users to share the same image files, it is recommended that
images are placed in a shared directory in the file-system, for example in
<tt>/opt/virtutech/images/</tt>. After installing Simics, a reference to this
directory should be added in the installation wide startup file
<tt>[simics]/config/startup-commands</tt>:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
add-directory /opt/virtutech/images/
</pre>
