    <a name="label616"></a><h3 class="jdocu">7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timing problems</h3 class="jdocu">

    
    If you have problems typing in the password when logging in
    because the simulated machine times out too quickly you can issue the 
    Simics command:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; enable-real-time-mode
</pre>
    This will cause Simics not to run faster then the the wall clock.
    Normally this is not a problem and it will only happens when the x86 processor
    is sitting idle on a HLT instruction.
<p>
    For NetBSD, you will also need to lower the check interval to
    avoid repeated keystrokes:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; enable-real-time-mode check_interval=100
</pre>
<p>
    To run as fast as possible again you simply run the command:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; disable-real-time-mode
</pre>
    See the Reference Manual for further information.
    <a name="label617"></a><h3 class="jdocu">7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Console input</h3 class="jdocu">

    
<p>
    Certain key combinations are normally caught by the host operating
    system or the window manager and may have dangerous side effects. An
    example is the ctrl + alt + del combination used to bring up the task
    manager on Windows and to reboot Linux systems. Such key combinations
    can be safely inserted using Simics commands instead.
<p>
    For example to send ctrl + alt + del:
    <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; con0.input -e "C-A-Del"
    </pre>
<p>
    Regular strings can also be issued:
    <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; con0.input "mkdir foo\n"
    </pre>
<p>
    There are also some functions written in Python available in the
    <tt>home/scripts/expect.py</tt> file. They can be used to wait for
    certain output to appear on the simulated screen. Similar functionality is
    also available through the console if the <tt>use_video_text_console</tt> option
    has been activated.
<p>
    <a name="label618"></a><h3 class="jdocu">7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BIOS Timer Error</h3 class="jdocu">

    
<p>
    The firmware will most likely pause, complaining about a <tt>Timer
    Error</tt>. At that point F1 must be pressed to continue the boot
    process. To send F1 to the system issue:
<p>
    <pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simics&gt; con0.input -e "F1"
    </pre>
<p>
    The halt on system error can also be disabled through the firmware
    configuration menues.
<p>
    
    <a name="label619"></a><h3 class="jdocu">7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the Processor Clock Frequency</h3 class="jdocu">


<a name="label620"></a> 
<a name="label621"></a>
<a name="label622"></a>
<p>
The clock frequency of a simulated processor can be set arbitrarily in
Simics.  This will not affect the actual speed of simulation, but it
will affect the number of instructions that need to be executed for a
certain amount of simulated time to pass.  If your execution only
depends on executing a certain number of instructions, increasing the clock frequency will take
the same amount of host time (but a shorter amount of target
time). However, if there are time based delays of some kind in the simulation,
these will take  longer to execute. 
<p>
At a simulated 1 MHz, one million target instructions will correspond to a
simulated second (assuming the simple default timing of one cycle per
instruction). At 100 MHz, on the other hand, it will take 100 million
target instructions to complete a simulated second. So with a higher clock
frequency, less simulated target time is going to pass for a certain
period of host execution time.
<p>
If Simics is used to emulate an interactive system (especially one
with a graphical user interface) it is a good idea to set the clock
frequency quite low.  Keyboard and mouse inputs events are handled by
periodic interrupts in most operating systems, using a higher clock
frequency will result in longer delays between invocations of periodic
interrupts.  Thus, the simulated system will feel slower in its user
response, and update the mouse cursor position etc. less frequently.
If this is a problem, the best technique for running experiments at a
high clock frequency is to first complete the configuration of the
machine using a low clock frequency.  Save all configuration changes
to a disk diff (like when installing operating systems).  Then change
the configuration to use a higher a clock frequency and reboot the
target machine.
<p>
Note that for a lightly-loaded machine (for example, working at an
interactive prompt on a serial console to an embedded Linux system),
Simics will often execute quickly enough at the real target clock
frequency that there is no need to artifically lower it.
