<p>
If you want to install another operating system on Simics/ARM, it must be a
statically linked binary in either ELF format or some format that can be loaded
straight into memory without modification.
<p>
If you have an ELF binary that you want to install, you use the
<b>load-binary</b> command. It loads an ELF file into memory and performs
the necessary relocation.  The <tt>arm-sa1110.simics</tt> script uses
the <b>load-binary</b> command to load the Linux kernel directly into the
memory of the simulated machine.
<p>
If you instead have a binary in some format that can be loaded straight into
memory without modification, you can use the <b>load-file</b> command. The
<tt>arm-sa1110.simics</tt> script uses the <b>load-file</b>
command to load the RAM disk and faked bootloader information directly into the
memory of the simulated machine.
<p>
If you are trying to install another Linux kernel, you must use the plain
<tt>vmlinux</tt> file, not the <tt>Image</tt> file used to install
Linux on a system that boots from a disk.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Standard Linux configurations for StrongARM machines will likely not
work. Support for devices not present in <nobr>Simics/ARM</nobr> will have to
be removed for the kernel to work. It is actually unlikely that another
operating system than Linux will work on the arm-sa1110, especially if it
uses or expects any particular devices to be present. <hr class="jdocu_note">
