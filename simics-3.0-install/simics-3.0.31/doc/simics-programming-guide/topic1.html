<h3 class="jdocu">1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conventions</h3 class="jdocu">


       <p>
Let us take a quick look at the conventions used throughout the Simics
documentation. Scripts, screen dumps and code fragments are presented in a
<tt>monospace</tt> font. In screen dumps, user input is always presented in
bold font, as in:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
Welcome to the Simics prompt
simics&gt; <b>this is something that you should type</b>
</pre>
<p>
Sometimes, artificial line breaks may be introduced to prevent the text from
being too wide. When such a break occurs, it is indicated by a small arrow
pointing down, showing that the interrupted text continues on the next line:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
This is an artificial <img src="nextline.png">
line break that shouldn't be there.
</pre>
<p>
<a name="label3"></a>
<a name="label4"></a>
<p>
The directory where Simics is installed is referred to as
<tt>[simics]</tt>, for example when mentioning the
<tt>[simics]/README</tt> file. In the same way, the shortcut
<tt>[workspace]</tt> is used to point at the user's workspace directory.
