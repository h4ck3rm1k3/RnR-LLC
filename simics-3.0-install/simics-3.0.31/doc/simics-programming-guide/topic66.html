<p>
<a name="label350"></a><h4 class="jdocu">In a Timing Model</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
An object listening on the <tt>timing-model</tt> interface is
presented with memory transactions before they have been executed, and
may therefore change both their semantics and their timing. Here is a
list of changes that a timing model is authorized to perform:
<p>
<dl><dt><b>Setting <tt>mem_op-&gt;ignore</tt></b></dt><dd>If set to 1, the memory
transaction will not be executed.</dd><dt><b>Setting <tt>mem_op-&gt;reissue</tt></b></dt><dd>If set to 1 and the memory
hierarchy is stalling, the memory transaction will be sent again to the timing
model after the stalling was performed. If set to 0, the transaction will be
executed without further calls to the timing model.</dd><dt><b>Setting <tt>mem_op-&gt;block_STC</tt></b></dt><dd>If set to 1, the transaction
won't be cached in the STCs, ensuring that the next access to the same memory
area will be sent to the timing model. Default is 0, unless the transaction has
side-effects that would prevent it from being cached.</dd><dt><b>Stalling the Memory Transaction</b></dt><dd>By returning a non-zero number of
cycles, the <b><i>operate()</i></b> function will stall the memory transaction
that was passed as argument for that amount of time.</dd></dl>
<p>
If a zero stall time is returned, some additional operations are
allowed:
<p>
<dl><dt><b>Setting <tt>mem_op-&gt;exception</tt></b></dt><dd>If set to an exception, the
transaction will be interrupted and an exception will be taken. Default is no
exception (<tt>Sim_PE_No_Exception</tt>).</dd><dt><b>Setting <tt>mem_op-&gt;user_ptr</tt></b></dt><dd>This <tt>void *</tt> pointer
is not touched by Simics during the memory operation execution. It can be used
to pass information from a timing model to a snoop device.</dd><dt><b>Memory Store Value</b></dt><dd>Since the memory operation has not been
executed yet, it is possible to change the value of a store operation in the
timing model. However, it is <em>important</em> to restore the original
value in the snoop device once the operation has been performed. The
<b><i>SIM_get_mem_op_value()</i></b> and <b><i>SIM_set_mem_op_value()</i></b>
functions (and their variants) can be used to get and set the value of a given
memory transaction.</dd></dl>
<p>

<a name="label351"></a><h4 class="jdocu">In a Snoop Device</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
An object listening on the <tt>snoop-memory</tt> interface is presented
with memory transactions after they have completed. It cannot influence the
execution of the operation and it may not return a non-zero value for stalling,
but it is allowed to modify the value of the memory operation. Since the data
returned by read operations are available at this stage, the snoop device is
also an ideal place to trace memory transactions.
<p>
The following actions are allowed:
<p>
<dl><dt><b>Change a Memory Store Value</b></dt><dd>If the value of a memory store has
been changed in the timing model, it should be reset in the
snoop device.</dd><dt><b>Change a Memory Load Value</b></dt><dd>Since the operation has been performed,
the snoop device is the right place to change the value of a load. This is done
with the usual <b><i>SIM_get/set_mem_op_value()</i></b> functions.</dd></dl>
