When sending blocks of data around in the simulation, it is often very
important that this can be done in an efficient manner, which usually
means that memory copies need to be avoided as much as possible.  The
typical case for this is in the simulation of networks or other
communication links where the hardware model constructs network
packets, often by reading from simulated memory, and sends the them
over a network link to one or more receivers.  These receivers can
then each do their modifications to the packets and hand them over to
software running on the simulated target system.  By using the
<tt>dbuffer_t</tt> type, Simics network simulation can do this
with a minimum of overhead.
