A module may also want to react to certain Simics events. This may both be
events related to the simulated machine, like processor exceptions or control
register writes, and other kinds of events, like Simics stopping the simulation
and returning to the command line. In Simics such events are referred to as
<em>haps</em>. To react to a hap a module can register a callback function to
the hap. This callback function will then be called every time the hap
occurs. Again, a complete list of all haps, descriptions of what parameters the
callback functions should take and all functions used to register callbacks and
manipulate haps can be found in the <em>Simics Reference Manual</em>.
<p>
DML has no built-in features for hap, so you should refer to the C/C++ and
Python explanation in section <a class="jdocu" href="topic32.html#label171">6.8</a>.
