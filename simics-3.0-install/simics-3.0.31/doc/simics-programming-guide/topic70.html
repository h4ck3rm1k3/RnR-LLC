<h3 class="jdocu">14.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
This section gives an overview of the most common operations in the
dbuffer API.
<p>
To create a new dbuffer, call the <b><i>new_dbuffer</i></b> function.
This will return a pointer to a <tt>dbuffer_t</tt> that is used in
later API calls to manipulate the dbuffer.
<p>
To add data to the buffer, the most commonly used function is
<b><i>dbuffer_append</i></b>.  It will extend the size of the dbuffer by
the given amount of bytes and return a pointer to the newly added
bytes.  This pointer can be used to move data into the buffer by using
it as the destination address of <b><i>memcpy</i></b> call, or any other
suitable way.  The pointer returned by <b><i>dbuffer_append</i></b>, or
the similar functions <b><i>dbuffer_prepend</i></b> and
<b><i>dbuffer_insert</i></b> can only be used to write data to the newly
added part of the dbuffer, since the memory allocated for the dbuffer
may not be contiguous.
<p>
There are two ways to read data from the dbuffer, and to write data to
it.  The first is the simple way of using <b><i>dbuffer_read</i></b>,
<b><i>dbuffer_update</i></b> and <b><i>dbuffer_replace</i></b> which will
return a pointer to a memory block that contains the data that is to
be read from or written to.  However, sometimes the data in the
dbuffer needs to be reshuffled or copied to produce a contiguous block
of memory.  To minimize the overhead, it is better to use the
<b><i>dbuffer_read_some</i></b>, <b><i>dbuffer_update_some</i></b> and
<b><i>dbuffer_replace_some</i></b> functions instead.
<p>
Another important aspect of the dbuffer API is that it is cheap to
make a copy of a dbuffer.  The <b><i>dbuffer_clone</i></b> function will
return a new dbuffer that contains the same data as a given dbuffer,
but the two dbuffers are completely independent, so any changes you
make to one copy will not affect the other.  The cloning is done using
a copy-on-write mechanism internally, which means that it doesn't need
to copy any data from the original dbuffer, but if one of the dbuffers
is updated in a way that would affect the data in the other, a copy of
at least parts of the data will be done behind the scenes.  Some
updates, such as appending to the dbuffer, is still without overhead.
<p>
Finally, when the dbuffer is no longer needed, the
<b><i>dbuffer_free</i></b> function should be called.
<p>
See the API section for the full documentation of the dbuffer API.
