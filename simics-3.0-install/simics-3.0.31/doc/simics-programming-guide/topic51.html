<p>
DS12887 is a very common real-time clock device. It is used, among other
places, in PC computers. There are also many other devices that are extensions
of the DS12887, for example, DS17485 and M5823.
<p>
Normally the module and device class would both have been named
<b>DS12887</b>, but because Virtutech already had a DS12887 device
model written in C, the sample DML module and the device class are named
<b>DS12887-dml</b>.
<p>
It may be good to have the documentation for the DS12887 chip when looking at
the sample code, so that you can compare the code to the specification. The
documentation can be found on the Internet, search for <tt>ds12887.pdf</tt> on
<tt>www.google.com</tt> and you will get lots of links to it.
<p>
The source code for the sample device can be found in the directory
<tt>[simics]/src/devices/DS12887-dml</tt>. If you want to try modifying
the DS12887 yourself, we recommend that you set up a user workspace and copy
the source code there, as described in section <a class="jdocu" href="topic4.html#label20">3</a>.
<p>
If you compile the DS12887-dml module yourself, you will see some compilation
warnings like this:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
/home/mve/simics/src/devices/DS12887-dml/DS12887.dml:291: <img src="nextline.png">
In DS12887_dml.time.set
/home/mve/simics/src/devices/DS12887-dml/DS12887.dml:291: <img src="nextline.png">
warning: not a function: sscanf
</pre>
<p>
They do not indicate any error. They are caused by a limitation in the current
DML compiler. There is currently no support for proper declarations of C
functions with variable numbers of arguments, which causes the warnings.

<p>
If your distribution contains the simulated machine <em>enterprise</em>, you
can find the Simics script <tt>enterprise-DS12887-dml.simics</tt> in the
directory <tt>[simics]/targets/x86-440bx</tt>. This file creates an
enterprise machine using the <b>DS12887-dml</b> module instead of the
default <b>DS12887</b> module. The DS12887 object is called
<b>rtc0</b>.
<p>
You can, for example, log what is happening to the device during the boot by
setting the log level of the <b>rtc0</b> object to 3:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>rtc0.log-level 3</b>
[rtc0] Changing log level: 1 -&gt; 3
simics&gt; c
[rtc0 info] Update-ended interrupt triggered, raising UF.
Pressing return
[rtc0 info] Periodic interrupt frequency set to 1024.000000 Hz.
[rtc0 info] Periodic interrupt triggered, raising PF.
[rtc0 info] UF lowered.
[rtc0 info] PF lowered.
[rtc0 info] UIE set.
[rtc0 info] Periodic interrupt triggered, raising PF.
[rtc0 info] Update-ended interrupt triggered, raising UF.
[rtc0 info] Raising interrupt.
[rtc0 info] UF lowered.
[rtc0 info] PF lowered.
[rtc0 info] Lowering interrupt.
[rtc0 info] UIE cleared.
[rtc0 info] Periodic interrupt triggered, raising PF.
[rtc0 info] Update-ended interrupt triggered, raising UF.
</pre>
<p>
If you raise the log level to 4 all access the processor does to the device
will be logged. The <b>rtc0</b> object is accessed a lot during the boot,
so you probably don't want to run the entire boot with log level 4.
<p>
Note that Linux only uses the real-time clock while booting and shutting
down. Once it has booted it uses other timers to keep the time, so to get Linux
to access the D12887 again once it has booted, you have to reboot the system.

<a name="label246"></a><h4 class="jdocu">10.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments to the Code</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
The source code of the DS12887 module is quite richly commented, so if you have
the documentation for the DS12887 chip you should hopefully be able to
understand most of the code without too much problem.
<p>
The DS12887 model is quite complete. The few limitations are listed at the top
of the source file.
<p>
A difference between the documentation of the DS12887 and the model is that the
model has two register banks, while the documentation only describes one. This
is because of the way the device is used in PC computers. The registers
described in the documentation correspond to the <i>registers</i>
bank. When the device is used in a PC a small translation device with two
registers that forwards accesses to the registers of the DS12887 is mapped in
the port space. This translation device corresponds to the
<i>port_registers</i> bank. If you want to use the model as a pure DS12887,
just ignore the port_registers bank.
<p>
The model handles the updating of the time registers in a more complicated way
than absolutely necessary. A simple implementation could post an event that
raises the UIP flag and then an event that lowers the UIP flag, updates the
time registers and compares them to the alarm registers each simulated
second. To avoid having to post these events, the model instead saves the
simulated time that the real-time clock time was last set, and the time it was
set to. From this information the the current real-time clock time can be
calculated at any time, and the time registers are only updated when they are
read. There is a comment above the <i>base_time</i> attribute in the source
code that describes the details of the time representation.
<p>
Similarly, events for the periodic interrupt, alarm interrupt and update-ended
interrupt are only posted if the corresponding interrupt flag is not already
raised. This implementation means that, since Linux does not use the device
after the boot, the model does not need to post any more events once Linux has
booted.
<p>
The device model uses the time conversion functions <b><i>os_gmtime()</i></b> and
<b><i>os_timegm()</i></b>, available in the header file
<tt>simics/utils.h</tt>. These
are not part of the official Simics API, but they are very handy when you need
host-independent time conversion functions. They work like the
<b><i>gmtime()</i></b> and <b><i>timegm()</i></b> functions available on Unix hosts,
but are host independent. They also have the associated types
<tt>os_time_t</tt> and <tt>os_tm_t</tt>, which correspond to
<tt>time_t</tt> and <tt>struct tm</tt> on Unix hosts.
