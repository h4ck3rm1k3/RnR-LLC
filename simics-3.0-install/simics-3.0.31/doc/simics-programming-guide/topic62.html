<h3 class="jdocu">12.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various Component Features</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
The following additional "good to know" information about
components is provided to help the programmer gain a better
understanding of components rather than as coding guidelines.
<p>
<a name="label336"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checkpointing</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
Most of the state in a component is usually checkpointed via the attributes
used to configure it. There are also separate attributes that are only used for
checkpointing, discussed in sections <a class="jdocu" href="topic60.html#label280">12.3.1</a> and <a class="jdocu" href="topic61.html#label331">12.4.3</a>.
<p>
Things to checkpoint include state calculated or received during the connection
phase, since it may be needed to support later reconfiguration for hotplugging
components.
<p>
All information about connectors and connections is checkpointed automatically
by the component base class.
<p>

<a name="label337"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic Queue Assignment</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
All configuration objects in Simics that handle time in some way need a
<i><a name="label338">queue</a></i> attribute set. The queue is an object implementing an
event queue, also called time queue, needed for the time to advance. All
objects that have the same queue are said to be part of the same <em><a name="label339">time
domain</a></em>. The only objects that can be currently used as queues are
processors and objects of the class <b>clock</b>.
<p>
The component system automatically sets the queue attribute for all objects at
instantiation time, based on the component hierarchy. To override the automatic
queue assignment, for example on multi-processor boards where each processor
should be its own queue, simply assign the queue attribute when adding the
pre-configuration objects.
<p>

<a name="label340"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic Recorder Assignment</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
Devices that handle input such as serial and network devices, keyboards and
mice, usually implement a connection to a <b>recorder</b> object. All
their input passes through the recorder so that it may record the input to the
file and later replay the same input from the file.
<p>
The component system automatically creates a recorder and connects it to all
input devices that have a recorder attribute. A component can override this
automatic assignment by setting the recorder attribute itself for its objects.
<p>

<a name="label341"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inheritance</h4 class="jdocu">


Since components are written as classes in object-oriented Python, it is easy
to create new components that are similar to existing ones by using
<a name="label342">inheritance</a>. Instead of basing the component on the
<b>component_object</b> base class, another component class can be
used. The new component class can, for example, modify the connector list,
override the methods for adding object and connection information in the
parent class. Several south bridge components supported by Simics are all based
on the same <b>south_bridge_component</b> class, that in turn is based
on a class supplying legacy PC devices.
