<a name="label364"></a>
<p>
The client library provides non-threaded C primitives for all features of the
time server protocol. Using the time client library, interfacing to the time
server is as easy as a C function call.
<p>
The following primitives exists:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    typedef enum {
            Simtime_No_Error,
            Simtime_Socket_Error,         // errno contains last error
            Simtime_Timeout,              // global timeout (as specified in
                                          // simtime_connect)
            Simtime_Receive_Buffer_Full,  // the received message did not fit
                                          // in the buffer. It's probably a bug
                                          // in the time client library if it
                                          // happens
            Simtime_Parse_Error           // received message could not be
                                          // parsed
    } simtime_error_t;


    simtime_error_t simtime_query_time(simtime_context_t *ctx,
                                       double *time);

    simtime_error_t simtime_sleep(simtime_context_t *ctx,
                                  double seconds,
                                  double *time);

    simtime_error_t simtime_periodic_ping(simtime_context_t *ctx,
                                          double interval,
                                          double how_long,
                                          simtime_callback_t cb,
                                          void *user_data);
</pre>
<p>
<b><i>simtime_query_time</i></b> will return the current virtual time. It is not
expected to block very long (the time server will respond immediately when it
receives the query).
<p>
Although tempting, <b><i>simtime_query_time</i></b> should not be used in a tight
polling loop, as it will degrade Simics performance quite noticeable.
<p>
Depending on what the timing code looks like, one of the other primitives
should be used instead.
<p>
The <b><i>simtime_sleep</i></b> function will block for a specified number of
virtual seconds. Note that this function will never return if Simics is not
simulating, unless a global timeout is specified (see the
<b><i>simtime_connect</i></b> function). This is obviously because the virtual
time is not progressing when the simulation is not running.
<p>
If the timeout is not known beforehand, it may not be possible to use
<b><i>simtime_sleep</i></b>. In this case, <b><i>simtime_periodic_ping</i></b> might
be the solution. It will cause Simics to send periodic pings to the client.
The interval between each ping is in real seconds, i.e. host time, not Simics
time. It is also possible to specify a duration, also in real seconds, after
which Simics will stop sending ping messages. If <i>duration</i> is
negative or zero, Simics will continue to send ping messages until told to
stop (non-zero return value from ping message callback function).
<p>
For every ping message, the callback function <b><i>cb</i></b> will be called:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    typedef int (*simtime_callback_t)(void *data,
                                      simtime_context_t *ctx,
                                      int seq_no, double time);
</pre>
<p>
<i>seq_no</i> contains the sequence number of the received ping
message and <i>time</i> contains the current virtual time.
<p>
If the callback function returns a value other than zero, the periodic pings
will be aborted, even though <i>duration</i> real seconds has not yet
passed.
<p>
Note that <b><i>simtime_periodic_ping</i></b> will not return until
<i>duration</i> real seconds has passed, or until the callback function
returns a non-zero value. Also note that no simtime API calls should be made
from the callback.
<p>
Before any of the above primitives can be used, a connection to the time server
has to be established:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    simtime_context_t *simtime_connect(const char *host,
                                       int port,
                                       int global_timeout);
    void simtime_disconnect(simtime_context_t *ctx);
</pre>
<p>
The time client will connect to a time server on <i>host</i> at port
<i>port</i>. If <i>global_timeout</i> is larger than zero,
all calls to simtime will timeout after <i>global_timeout</i> real
seconds. This is useful to detect, for example, a crashed Simics session. But
note that a call to e.g. <b><i>simtime_sleep</i></b> may take very long real time,
depending on how fast Simics is simulating (and, of course, how long the
sleep time is).
<p>
To disconnect from the time server, call the function
<b><i>simtime_disconnect</i></b>.
<p>
If the client is threaded, care must be taken to not make more than one API
call at a time. The time client library is not designed to handle simultanious
calls.
