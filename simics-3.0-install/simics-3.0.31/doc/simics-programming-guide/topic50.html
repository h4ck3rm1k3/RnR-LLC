<p>
AM79C960 was a rather common ISA Ethernet card, used mostly in PCs. It may be a
little out-dated by now, but still serves as a good example.
<p>
Normally the module and device class would both have been named
<b>AM79C960</b>, but because Virtutech already had a AM79C960 device
model written in C, the sample DML module and the device class are named
<b>AM79C960-dml</b>.
<p>
It may be good to have the documentation for the AM79C960 chip when looking at
the sample code, so that you can compare the code to the specification. The
documentation can be found on the Internet, search for <tt>am79c960.pdf</tt> on
<tt>www.google.com</tt> and you will get lots of links to it.
<p>
The source code for the sample device can be found in the directory
<tt>[simics]/src/devices/AM79C960-dml</tt>. If you want to try modifying
the <b>AM79C960-dml</b> module yourself, we recommend that you set up
a user workspace and copy the source code there, as described in section <a class="jdocu" href="topic4.html#label20">3</a>.
<p>
If you compile the <b>AM79C960-dml</b>
module yourself, you will see some compilation
warnings like this:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
/home/mve/simics/src/devices/AM79C960-dml/AM79C960.dml:567: <img src="nextline.png">
In AM79C960_dml.mac_address.set
/home/mve/simics/src/devices/AM79C960-dml/AM79C960.dml:567: <img src="nextline.png">
warning: not a function: sscanf
</pre>
<p>
They do not indicate any error. They are caused by a limitation in the current
DML compiler. There is currently no support for proper declarations of C
functions with variable numbers of arguments, which causes the warnings.

<p>
If your distribution contains the simulated machine <em>enterprise</em>, you
can find the Simics script <tt>enterprise-AM79C960-dml.simics</tt> in the
directory <tt>[simics]/targets/x86-440bx</tt>. This file creates an
enterprise machine using the <b>AM79C960-dml</b> module instead of
the default <b>AM79C960 module</b>. The AM79C960 object is called
<b>lance0</b>.
<p>
To do something interesting with the AM79C960 model we need to connect it to
something that it can talk to. We can use a <b>service-node</b> for
this. These commands create an <b>ethernet-link</b>, a
<b>service-node</b> and connect the AM79C960 device to the
<b>ethernet-link</b>:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>new-ethernet-link</b>
Created ethernet-link ethlink0
simics&gt; <b>new-service-node link = ethlink0 ip = 10.10.0.1 <img src="nextline.png">
netmask = 255.255.255.0</b>
Created service-node ethlink0_sn0
Connecting ethlink0_sn0 to ethlink0
Setting IP address of ethlink0_sn0 on network ethlink0 to 10.10.0.1
ethlink0_sn0
simics&gt; <b>lance0.connect ethlink0</b>
</pre>
<p>
Start the simulation and let the machine boot and login as the user
<tt>root</tt>. No password is required. Stop the simulation and set the log
level of the <b>lance0</b> object to 2:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>lance0.log-level 2</b>
[lance0] Changing log level: 1 -&gt; 2
</pre>
<p>
You can now start the simulation again and send a ping packet to the
<b>service-node</b> by entering <tt>ping -c 1 10.10.0.1</tt> in the
console on the simulated machine. The <b>lance0</b> object will log what
happens:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>c</b>
[lance0 info] Packet sent, dst ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, <img src="nextline.png">
src 10:10:10:10:10:30, length 64 bytes.
[lance0 info] Packet received, dst 10:10:10:10:10:30, <img src="nextline.png">
src 20:20:20:20:20:00, length 64 bytes.
[lance0 info] MAC address matches, packet accepted.
[lance0 info] Packet sent, dst 20:20:20:20:20:00, <img src="nextline.png">
src 10:10:10:10:10:30, length 102 bytes.
[lance0 info] Packet received, dst 10:10:10:10:10:30, <img src="nextline.png">
src 20:20:20:20:20:00, length 102 bytes.
[lance0 info] MAC address matches, packet accepted.
</pre>
<p>
We can see that the enterprise machine first sends a 64-byte packet to the
broadcast address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff and then receives a 64-byte reply from
20:20:20:20:20:00, the MAC address of the <b>service-node</b>. These
are an ARP request and an ARP reply to get the MAC address of the
<b>service-node</b>.
<p>
After this the enterprise machines sends a 102-byte packet to the
<b>service-node</b> and receives a 102-byte reply. These are the actual
ping request and ping reply.
<p>
If you try to ping again you may not see the ARP packets, since the simulated
machine may already have the MAC address of the <b>service-node</b>.
<p>
If you want more detailed logs you can change the log level to 3 or 4. At log
level 3 a lot more information about what is going on in the device will be
logged. The device polls for packets to transmit regularly, so this will cause
a lot of output. At log level 4 all accesses that the processor does to the
device will also be logged.

<a name="label243"></a><h4 class="jdocu">10.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments to the Code</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
The source code of the AM79C960 module is quite richly commented, so if you
have the documentation for the AM79C960 chip you should hopefully be able to
understand most of the code without too much problem.
<p>
The AM79C960 model is far from complete, it implements just enough
functionality that the device model can be used with Linux 2.4. A list of known
limitations can be found at the top of the source file.
<p>
The implementation of the model is quite straight forward. There is one unusual
design, though. The AM79C960 device has many 32-bit and 64-bit values that are
split into multiple 16-bit register. The model stores many of these values in a
separate attributes, and makes the registers reflect the attribute by using the
<i>data_accessor</i> template.
<p>
For example, the 64-bit <em>Logical Address Filter</em> that resides in CSR8 -
CSR11 is stored in the <i>logical_address_filter</i> attribute. Some of the
registers, for example, CSR24 and CSR 25 that contain <em>Base Address of
Receive Ring</em>, are not even implemented and the values are only stored in
separate attributes.
