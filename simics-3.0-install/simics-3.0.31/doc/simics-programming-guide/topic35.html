<h3 class="jdocu">7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example of a new command</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
This is an example on how to add a command in Python, as it would appear in
the <tt>commands.py</tt> file of a module's source code subdirectory:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
# this line imports definitions needed below
from cli import *

# this is my Python function that will be called when the
# command is invoked from the Simics prompt.
def my_command_fun(int_arg, str_arg, flag_arg):
    print "My integer: %d" % int_arg
    print "My string: %s" % str_arg
    print "Flag is",
    if flag_arg:
        print "given"
    else:
        print "not given"
    return int_arg

# register our new command
new_command("my-command", my_command_fun,
            args  = [arg(int_t, "arg", "?", 10), arg(str_t, "name"),
                     arg(flag_t, "-f")],
            alias = "mc",
            type  = "my-module-commands",
            short = "my command does it",
            doc_items = [("NOTE", "This command is best")],
            see_also = ["my_other_command"],
            doc = """
&lt;b&gt;my-command&lt;/b&gt; is best.
This is its documentation. &lt;i&gt;arg&lt;/i&gt;
is the first argument...""")
</pre>
<p>
The code above will define a command called <b>my-command</b>. When the
command is invoked from the Simics command line interface, the function
<b><i>my_command_fun()</i></b> will be called. The function must take exactly as
many arguments as the command; in this case 3: an integer, a string, and a
flag. The first command argument is called "<i>arg</i>" and is optional,
 indicated by <tt>"?"</tt>. If omitted by the user, the command function will
be called with the default value, 10. The second argument is called "name" and
is required (since there is no <tt>"?"</tt>, there is no default value). The
last argument is a flag and will have a value of 1 if the flag is given,
otherwise 0. Flags are thus always optional.
<p>
If the command function returns a value (a string or an integer) Simics will
print this value on the terminal or pass it on to other commands as input
arguments, e.g., <b>print -x (my-command 15 foo)</b>.
<p>
Writing <b>help my-command</b> at the Simics prompt will display:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
NAME
   my-command - my command does it
SYNOPSIS
   my-command [arg] name [-f]
ALIAS
   mc
DESCRIPTION
   my-command is best. This is its documentation. <i>arg</i> is the first argument.
NOTE
   This command is best
SEE ALSO
   my_other_command
</pre>
<p>

The command can be invoked in different ways, here are some examples:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>my-command 2 foo -f</b>
My integer: 2
My string: foo
Flag is given
2
simics&gt; <b>my-command bar</b>
My integer: 10
My string: bar
Flag is not given
10
simics&gt; <b>my-command 20 -f</b>
Argument error: argument number 2 is missing in 'my-command', string expected.
SYNOPSIS: my-command [arg] name [-f]
simics&gt; <b>print -x (mc -f name="hello there!" arg = 23)</b>
My integer: 23
My string: hello there!
Flag is given
0x17
</pre>
<p>
In the last case the alias is used and the command is passed to the
print command that outputs the value in hexadecimal notation.
<p>
All the parameters of the <b><i>new_command()</i></b> function will be
explained bellow. After the parameter name follows the type of the
parameter and if the argument is required, recommended, or optional:
<p>
<dl><dt><b><b>name</b> &#8212; string (required)</b></dt><dd>First argument (no need to
write name =) and the name of the command. May include digits and underscores
as well as dashes. Must begin with a letter.</dd><dt><b><b>fun</b> &#8212; function (required)</b></dt><dd>The command handler
function that will be called when the command is executed. The number of
arguments must match the <tt><b>args</b></tt>-list(see below). Since
new_command is executed when the <tt>commands.py</tt> file is loaded into
Python the function must be defined before the new_command call, as in the
example.</dd><dt><b><tt><b>args</b></tt> &#8212; list of argument specifiers (required)</b></dt><dd>This is a list of the arguments given to the command, and must match the
arguments of the function described above. An argument specifier is created by
calling the function <b><i>arg()</i></b>. This function takes as arguments a type
(this is in fact also a function), that is called to handle the
argument. Examples of available types are <tt>int_t</tt>,
<tt>str_t</tt>, <tt>addr_t</tt>, <tt>filename_t()</tt>, and
<tt>flag_t</tt>. See the next section for a discussion of these.
<p>
To create an argument list of an integer and a string, use:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
..., args = [arg(int_t), arg(str_t)], ...
</pre>
<p>
It is, however, recommended that names for the parameters are specified.
This is done as a second argument for <b><i>arg()</i></b>:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
..., args = [arg(int_t, "value"), arg(str_t, "file")], ...
</pre>
<p>
This way the documentation of the argument list (<b>help</b> command) will
use these names and also makes it possible to enter the argument in any
order at the command line, e.g.,
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
command file = "/tmp/bar" value = 17
</pre>
<p>
The <b>flag</b> type requires the name to be specified and the name must begin
with a hyphen, e.g., "&#8211;all". The corresponding value passed to the
command handler function will be 1 if the flag is given on the command line or
0 otherwise.
<p>
The <b>addr</b> type can be used for addresses. It understands argument of
the form <tt>p:0xcf00</tt> (physical address), <tt>v:0xff00</tt> (virtual
address), or <tt>0xffdc</tt> at the command line. The command handler
function will receive a tuple of the prefix and the address, e.g.,
<tt>("v",
0xcff0)</tt>. If only the address is given, <tt>"v"</tt> will be used.
<p>
Sometimes it is convenient to have other arguments than flags optional. To
indicate this, add <tt>"?"</tt> as the third argument to <b>arg()</b>, and
the default value as the fourth; e.g.,
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
..., args = [arg(int_t, "value", "?", 1),
             arg(str_t, "file")], ...
</pre>
makes <tt>value</tt> an optional argument with 1 as its default value.
<p>
The <b><i>arg</i></b> function takes more parameters than those already mentioned:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
..., args = [arg(str_t, "cpu",
             expander = exp_fun,
             is_a = test_fun)], ...
</pre>
<p>
will connect an argument completion (expander) function for the
<i>cpu</i> arg, i.e., the function <b><i>exp_fun()</i></b> will be
called when the user presses the TAB key while entering the argument
value. The expander function takes an argument representing the text
the user has written for the argument. For example, if the user
presses TAB after typing <b>command cpu = ultr</b>, the
<b><i>exp_fun()</i></b> will be passed <tt>"ultr"</tt> and should return
a list of strings completing <tt>"ultr"</tt>. Here is an example of an
expander function:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
def exp_fun(comp):
    return get_completions(comp, ["ultraI", "ultraII",
                                  "ultraIII", "pentium"])
</pre>
<p>
When called with <tt>"ultr"</tt>, it will return <tt>["ultraI", "ultraII",
"ultraIII"]</tt>.  The get_completions function filters the list and keep
elements with prefix comp. The expander functions only works for the
string type for the moment.
<p>
The <i>is_a</i> argument takes a function that tests if the
argument is valid. It should return 1 for valid values and 0
otherwise. For example the read-reg command has as first argument a
CPU (optional) and as second argument a register. If a user types
<b>read-reg g7</b>, CLI will incorrectly interpret g7 as a CPU
since g7 is a valid string and the command will fail. The
<b><i>is_a</i></b> function could therefore return 0 for non-CPUs and
pass the string to the next argument, which will match since
<tt>g7</tt> is a register.
<p>
<b>Polyvalue</b>
<p>
A command argument can be of multiple types as well
(<i>polyvalues</i>). For example,
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">...,
args = [ arg((str_t, int_t, flag_t), ("cpu","value","-all"), "?",
             (int_t, 0, "value"), expander = (exp1, exp2, None)) ],
...</pre>
<p>
will create an argument that is either a string, an integer, or a
flag. The argument passed to the command handler function is a tuple
specifying the arg-type, the value, and the name of the
argument. E.g., <b>command foo</b> will pass <tt>(str_t, "foo",
"cpu")</tt> to the command handler function. This is why the default
value looks the way it does. The corresponding expander function will
also be used. <b>command cpu = abc&lt;tab&gt;</b> will use the
<tt>exp1</tt> expander. </dd><dt><b><b>doc</b> &#8212; string (required if not doc_with is used)</b></dt><dd>
<a name="label189"></a>
This is the documentation of the command. Some simple, HTML-like formatting
markup can be used, such as <tt>&lt;i&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;b&gt;</tt> and
<tt>&lt;br/&gt;</tt> for
italic, bold and line-break. A blank line separates paragraphs. Italic
does not usually work in terminals so underlining will be used instead. Use
italics when referring to arguments and bold for command names.
</dd><dt><b><b>type</b> &#8212; string (default is "misc-commands")</b></dt><dd>
This is the command category that the command belongs to. All
categories will be listed when the <b>help</b> command is used.
<b>help</b> <i>category</i> will list all command in that category.
Any whitespace within this string will be replaced with dashes.
</dd><dt><b><b>short</b> &#8212; string (recommended)</b></dt><dd>
A short description of the command used when listing commands
(e.g. <b>help</b> &#8211;all).
</dd><dt><b><b>repeat</b> &#8212; function (optional)</b></dt><dd>If such a function is supplied, it will be called when the user
enters an empty line (i.e., just presses enter) after this command has
been run. The arguments passed to the <b>repeat</b> function will be
the same as those of <b>fun</b> (see above). This is used to implement
the behavior of commands like <b>disassemble</b>, where pressing
enter after having run one <b>disassemble</b> command disassembles
the instructions following the last one of the previous command.</dd><dt><b><b>namespace</b> &#8212; string (optional)</b></dt><dd>
Makes the command a <i>namespace</i> command. Such commands are invoked as a
method call of the form <tt></tt><em>object</em><tt>.</tt><em>command</em><tt></tt>, e.g.,
<tt>rec0.playback-start</tt>. This means that the command handler function
will get the namespace object as first argument (a recorder object) and
then the rest of the arguments. The namespace string is either the class
name of the object, e.g., <tt>"recorder"</tt>, or the name of a
"superclass" of the object, or an interface that the object implements. For
instance, the class name "processor" is a superclass of any processor,
e.g., "ultrasparc-ii", and "breakpoint" is an interface that a memory-space
object implements.
<p>
The full name of a namespace command will be &lt;class_or_interface&gt;.command
(angle brackets included) and this is what is printed when command are
listed, but as stated above the command is invoked with
<b>object.command</b>.
<p>
Device commands are typically implemented using namespace commands.
This is because they usually operate on a single configuration object,
e.g., a MMU or cache object.
</dd><dt><b><b>doc_with</b> &#8212; string (optional)</b></dt><dd> This argument
can be specified if a command should be documented together with
another one. For example the <b>disable</b> command is documented
with the <b>enable</b> command since they are tightly coupled
together. So the doc argument is missing for the disable command and
all documentation is written in the enable command. Note:
<b>doc_with</b> together with a namespace command  must be
given as "&lt;class_or_interface&gt;.command" </dd><dt><b><b>alias</b> &#8212; string or list of strings (optional)</b></dt><dd>Specify aliases for this command. Does not work with namespace commands.</dd><dt><b><b>infix</b> &#8212; 0,1 (default 0)</b></dt><dd>Indicates that the command should be an infix command. For example the
arithmetic command sets this argument to 1.
</dd><dt><b><b>pri</b> &#8212; integer (default is 0)</b></dt><dd>Sets the priority for the commands, typically only relevant to
infix commands. For example, <b>*</b> has higher priority than <b>+</b>
(200 and 100, respectively).</dd><dt><b><b>left</b> &#8212; 0,1 (default 0)</b></dt><dd>If the command is left associative or not (right associative).</dd></dl>
