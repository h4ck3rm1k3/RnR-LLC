<a name="label99"></a><h4 class="jdocu">5.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Interfaces</h4 class="jdocu">


<a name="label100"></a>
<p>
Using an interface in a module implemented in DML, is done by
<em>connecting</em> an object to the device model you are developing,
specifying which interfaces you are planning to use. 
<p>
The <tt>connect</tt> statement actually perform two steps at the same time: it
defines an attribute that can take an object as a value, and it tells the DML
compiler that a number of interfaces belonging to this object can be used in
the current device model.
<p>
The following code will create an <i>irq_dev</i> attribute that accepts
only objects implementing the <tt>simics_interrupt</tt> interface as a
value.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
connect irq_dev {
    parameter documentation = "The device that interrupts are sent to.";
    parameter configuration = "required";

    interface simple_interrupt;
}
</pre>
<p>
Once an object has been connected, using the interfaces that were specified is
simple:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    ...
    if ($irq_raised == 0 &amp;&amp; irq == 1) {
        log "info", 3: "Raising interrupt.";
        $irq_dev.simple_interrupt.interrupt($irq_dev, $irq_level);
    }
    ...
</pre>
<p>

<a name="label101"></a><h4 class="jdocu">5.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementing an Existing Interface</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
Implementing an existing interface in DML is done with the <em>implement</em>
statement, which contains the implementation of all the functions listed in the
interface. The interface is automatically registered by the DML compiler so
that other objects can use it on the current device model:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
implement ethernet_device {
    // Called when a frame is received from the network.
    method receive_frame(conf_object_t *link, dbuffer_t *frame) {
        inline $receive_packet(frame);
    }

    // Link speed negotiation functions. Unimplemented, we accept any speed.
    method auto_neg_request(phy_speed_t req_speed)-&gt;(phy_speed_t speed) {
        log "unimplemented", 2:
            "Link auto negotiation request (0x%llx)", cast(req_speed, uint64);
        speed = req_speed;
    }
    method auto_neg_reply(phy_speed_t speed) {
        log "unimplemented", 2:
            "Auto negotiation reply (0x%llx)", cast(speed, uint64);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>

<a name="label102"></a><h4 class="jdocu">5.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementing an New Interface</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
Implementing a new interface is pretty much the same as implementing an
existing interface, except that you must declare the structure defining the
interface first:
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
struct myifc_interface_t {
    int (*my_function)(conf_object_t *o, int i);
}

implement myifc {
    method my_function(int i) -&gt; (int j) {
        j = i + 1;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
There are a few things to remember:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>The <tt>implement</tt> statement assumes that an interface called
<tt>foo</tt> is defined in a structure called
<tt>foo_interface_t</tt>. In our case we define a structure called
<tt>myifc_interface_t</tt> to implement the interface <tt>myifc</tt>. All the
predefined Simics interfaces already follow to that rule.</li>
<p>
<li>The <tt>implement</tt> statement is done using DML <em>methods</em>, but
the interface is declared in a C-like structure with C function pointers. This
implies that all functions in the interface must take a <tt>conf_object_t
*</tt> pointer as first argument, since that's the standard declaration
implied by the keyword <tt>method</tt>. This argument corresponds to the object
the interface is applied upon.</li>
<p>
<li>To share an interface definition between DML and C code, the structure
definition must be moved in an external <tt>.h</tt> that will be included
in both the C code and the <tt>%header</tt> statement of the DML code. Refer to
the <em>DML Reference Manual</em> for more information.</li>
<p>
</ul>
