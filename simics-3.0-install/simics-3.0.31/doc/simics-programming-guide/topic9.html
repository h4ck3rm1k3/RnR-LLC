<p>
A Simics module is just some executable code loaded dynamically into the
simulator, so it could virtually perform any operation. To be of any practical
use however, a module has to interact with Simics, other modules, or the
user. Simics provides a set of functions (the Simics API) for the modules to
work within the simulator framework. The API defines a number of concepts like
classes, objects, interfaces, haps and events, which will be presented
below. The <em>Simics Reference Manual</em> provides the complete API
documentation.
<p>
Simics modules can be written using different programming languages:
<p>
<dl><dt><b>DML (Device Modeling Language)</b></dt><dd>DML has been designed to make
writing new device model as simple as possible. It integrates in the language
many of the concepts defined by the Simics API so that the user can focus on
the model rather than on the interaction with Simics. <em>This is by far the
best language to write a device model</em>. Note that although it was designed
with device models in mind, DML can be used to develop other types of
modules.</dd><dt><b>Python</b></dt><dd>Python can be used to quickly write a new Simics module. It
is well suited for Simics extensions that are not called very often, like some
types of statistics gathering, or BIOS emulation. It can also be used for fast
prototyping of more complex extensions that later on will be rewritten in a
compiled language like C or DML. Note that in all cases, DML is easier to use
than Python to write a device model.</dd><dt><b>C/C++</b></dt><dd>C/C++ can be used for writing any type of Simics
modules. Writing in C/C++ exposes all interactions with Simics, which can be
sometimes cumbersome. C/C++ development is only recommended if the
functionality being developed could seriously impact Simics performance (by
being called very often during execution, by manipulating large quantities of
data, ...). A few specialized functions in the API (like the
Micro-Architectural Interface) are only available to C/C++ modules.</dd></dl>
<p>
This chapter will cover the concepts that the Simics API defines. It will also
present how to use them, first in DML, then in Python and C/C++.
