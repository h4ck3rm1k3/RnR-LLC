<h3 class="jdocu">12.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h3 class="jdocu">


This chapter describes how to design and write new <a name="label271">components</a>. The
reader is assumed to be familiar with Simics components and how they are used,
as well as configuration classes, objects and attributes. The
<em>Configuration and Checkpointing</em> chapter in the <em>Simics User
Guide</em> contains relevant documentation.

<p>
Components are implemented in Python and are handled like any other Simics
objects. While a component object represents a hardware unit such as a
processor board, or PCI card, there are one or more configuration objects
associated with it that implement the actual functionality.
<p>
Components can be created, deleted, and connected to and disconnected from each
other. Each component defines a number of connectors that define how it can be
connected to other components. Connectors have direction, up or down. As a
result, the connected components form a tree-like hierarchy with a single
<em>top-level</em> component. There are also special connectors that are
neither up nor down: these connectors, called "any", can be used to connect
component hierarchies together.

<p>
Before writing new components it is important to define the system component
hierarchy. This includes deciding: what should the components contain; what
connectors are needed between them; if any new connector types are needed; and
in a large system, what component is the top-level one. A component should
typically have connectors that correspond to real-world connections that are
accessible to users. There is no point in having a connector between the
processor and the motherboard if, for example, the processor is soldered to it
and cannot be replaced. Connections on such a low level are handled by the
configuration objects that actually model the hardware.
