<p>
<a name="label280"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Component Class</h4 class="jdocu">


A component file contains Python classes that define all the component classes in a
component collection. These classes inherit from the component base class
<b><a name="label281">component_object</a></b>, or from one of its sub classes.
<p>
Component classes are registered with Simics using the
<b><i><a name="label282">register_component_class()</a></i></b> function. When a component
class is registered, a corresponding Simics class is created with the supplied
list of attributes. The Simics class uses the name stored in the
<tt>classname</tt> data member of the Python class.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">

def register_component_class(python_class,
                             attributes, checkpoint_attributes = [],
                             top_level = False)
</pre>
The first argument, <i>python_class</i>, is the Python component class,
<i>attributes</i> is a list of attributes that can be used to configure
the component at creation time. All attributes in this list will be available
as command arguments in the <b><a name="label283">create-<component></a></b> and
<b><a name="label284">new-<component></a></b> CLI commands. The format of each
attribute list entry is [&lt;name&gt;, &lt;kind&gt;, &lt;type&gt;, &lt;description&gt;].
See the documentation of <b><i><a name="label285">SIM_register_typed_attribute()</a></i></b>
for an explanation of these entries.
<p>
The <i>checkpoint_attributes</i> is a list with the same format as
<i>attributes</i>. The difference is that
<i>checkpoint_attributes</i> is only intended for attributes
representing internal state that has to be checkpointed. The attributes in this
list are not visible as arguments to the creation commands. This means that
the attributes can not be of the pseudo or required kinds.
<p>
The last argument, <i>top_level</i>, should be set to <tt>True</tt> for
top level components; the default value is <tt>False</tt>. The register
function will add some additional attributes for
<a name="label286">top level components</a>, and also check that the component class
implements all top-level-only methods.
<p>

<a name="label287"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Component Class Data Members</h4 class="jdocu">


There are a number of data members required in the Python component class that
are used by the generic component system. <a name="label288"></a>
<p>
<dl><dt><b><tt>classname</tt></b></dt><dd>The name of the Simics configuration class representing the component
class.
</dd><dt><b><tt>basename</tt></b></dt><dd>Default name for instances of this class if none is given when the user
creates a component. The complete default instance name is
&lt;basename&gt;_cmp&lt;number&gt;.
</dd><dt><b><tt>description</tt></b></dt><dd>A description of the component class. This will be the help text for the
configuration class in Simics.
</dd><dt><b><tt>connectors</tt></b></dt><dd>A list of all connectors for components of this class. The format of the
list is described in the next sub-section.
</dd></dl>
<p>
Example of a component class:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
class ide_disk_component(component_object):
    classname = 'std-ide-disk'
    basename = 'ide_disk'
    description = ('The "std-ide-disk" component represents an IDE disk.')

</pre>
<p>

<a name="label289"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining Connectors</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
The <tt><a name="label290">connectors</a></tt> member is a dictionary indexed by connector
name. For each connector there is another dictionary describing it with the
keywords <tt>type</tt>, <tt>direction</tt>, <tt>empty_ok</tt>, <tt>hotplug</tt>
and <tt>multi</tt>:
<p>
<dl><dt><b><tt>type</tt></b></dt><dd>The name of the connector type. The connector can only be connected to
other connectors of the same type.
</dd><dt><b><tt>direction</tt></b></dt><dd>One of <tt>up</tt>, <tt>down</tt> and <tt>any</tt>. Defines the direction
of the connector. A connector can only be connected with connectors of a
different direction; this is checked by the generic component connection code.
</dd><dt><b><tt>empty_ok</tt></b></dt><dd><tt>True</tt> if the connector may be empty after instantiation. The
component system will not allow instantiation of components that have empty
connectors with <tt>empty_ok</tt> set to <tt>False</tt>.
</dd><dt><b><tt>hotplug</tt></b></dt><dd><tt>True</tt> if the connector supports connecting and disconnecting after
the component has been instantiated. A hotplug connector must have empty_ok
set to <tt>True</tt>. A component where all connectors are either
<tt>hotplug</tt> or <tt>empty_ok</tt> is called a <i><a name="label291">standalone</a></i>
component.
</dd><dt><b><tt>multi</tt></b></dt><dd><tt>True</tt> if the connector supports multiple connections. A few
connectors allow several other connectors to be connected to them. One such
example is the ISA bus in legacy PC systems.
</dd></dl>
<p>

<a name="label292"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required Class Methods</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
There are a few class methods that have to be implemented by the component
class since they are used by the base class when the component is created:
<a name="label293"></a>
<p>
<dl><dt><b><tt><a name="label294">add_objects(self)</a></tt></b></dt><dd>Responsible for adding <a name="label295">pre-configuration objects</a> to the
component. The pre-configuration objects are Python objects that represent the
configuration objects before the component has been instantiated and the
actual configuration objects are created. The pre-configuration objects allow
attributes to be set without any side-effects and simplifies adding and
removing objects before the instantiation. A more detailed description of how
to add objects follows in the <a class="jdocu" href="#label310">12.3.7</a>
section. This method is not called when a checkpoint is loaded, since then the
object references will be set with real objects directly.
</dd><dt><b><tt><a name="label296">add_connector_info(self)</a></tt></b></dt><dd>Adds dynamic information about all connectors, such as what objects that
are involved in the connection and other connector specific data, for example
the slot number for PCI buses. This dynamic connector information is sent as
arguments to the corresponding connect method
(<a class="jdocu" href="#label315">12.3.9</a>) in the component being connected to. The
information is stored in the <tt>connector_info</tt> data member that is a
dictionary indexed with the connector name, and described in section
<a class="jdocu" href="#label312">12.3.8</a>.
</dd><dt><b><tt><a name="label297">connect_<connector-type>(self, connector, <connector arguments>)</a></tt></b></dt><dd> For each connector type that the component implements, there must be a
corresponding connect method. The second argument is the name of the actual
connector, and any following arguments are connector-type specific and provided
by the <b><i>add_connector_info()</i></b> method of the other component in the
connection. If the connector has hot-plug support, it must support connections
for both the instantiated and non-instantiated component.
</dd><dt><b><tt><a name="label298">disconnect_<connector-type>(self, connector)</a></tt></b></dt><dd>For each connector type that has hot-plug support that the component
implements, there must be a corresponding disconnect method. The second
argument is the name of the actual connector. The method must support
disconnections for both the instantiated and non-instantiated component.
</dd></dl>
<p>

<a name="label299"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optional Class Methods</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
There are several methods that have a default implementation in the base
component class, but that the component sub class may override.
<p>
<dl><dt><b><tt><a name="label300">__init__(self, parse_obj)</a></tt></b></dt><dd>The standard Python object constructor. Called when the object is created,
it may be used to initialize some state before any other method in the object
is called. If this method is implemented, it has to call the
<b><i>__init__()</i></b> method of the parent class.  </dd><dt><b><tt><a name="label301">finalize_instance(self)</a></tt></b></dt><dd>Called when the component object in Simics has been created. The first
thing <b><i>finalize_instance(self)</i></b> in the base class does is to call
<b><i>add_objects()</i></b> if the component is not instantiated. If this
method is implemented, it has to call the <b><i>finalize_instance()</i></b> method
of the parent class.
</dd><dt><b><tt><a name="label302">instantiation_done(self)</a></tt></b></dt><dd>Called when the component is instantiated. Note that this method is not
called when loading a checkpoint with already instantiated components.
If this method is implemented, it has to call the
<b><i>instantiation_done()</i></b> method of the parent class.
</dd></dl>
<p>

<a name="label303"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Top-level Class Methods</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
Top-level components need two additional methods that are used by the component
system to handle clock domain configuration and to keep track of all processors
in the component hierarchy. There is also one optional method that is used to
restore the processor list from a checkpoint.
<p>
<dl><dt><b><tt><a name="label304">get_clock(self)</a></tt></b></dt><dd>
Should return the processor object that is the default <i><a name="label305">clock</a></i>
in the component hierarchy, that is, in the top-level component and all
components below it. All configuration objects within this component hierarchy,
also called a <em><a name="label306">timing domain</a></em>, will have the same clock
object set as <i><a name="label307">queue</a></i>.  
</dd><dt><b><tt><a name="label308">get_processors(self)</a></tt></b></dt><dd>
Similar to <b><i>get_clock()</i></b> but should return a list of all processors in
the component hierarchy.
</dd><dt><b><tt><a name="label309">set_processors(self, cpu_list)</a></tt></b></dt><dd>
Optional method that is called when a checkpoint is loaded with a list of all
processors previously returned by <b><i>get_processors()</i></b>. If this method
is not implemented, the component should make sure that that it can recreate
the processor list after a checkpoint for use in <b><i>get_processors()</i></b>.
</dd></dl>
<p>

<a name="label310"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding Configuration Objects</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
When the component object has been created, the <b><i>add_objects()</i></b> method
is called. Its responsibility is to create pre-configuration objects
representing the configuration objects that implement the functionality of the
component. The <b>pre_obj()</b> Python class is typically used instead
of <b>pre_conf_object()</b>, since it provides improved name handling,
as described in <a class="jdocu" href="#label324">12.3.11</a>.
<p>
The pre-configuration objects should be added to the <tt>o</tt> namespace of
the component. When the component later is instantiated, all object references
in this namespace are converted to configuration objects.
<p>
The <tt><a name="label311">o</a></tt> namespace may contain simple pre-configuration
objects, and also arrays of objects.
<p>
Example from a Serengeti processor board component:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
def add_objects(self):
    for i in range(self.num_cores):
        self.o.mmu[i] = pre_obj('mmu(x + %d)' % i, self.mmuclass)
        self.o.cpu[i] = pre_obj('cpu(x + %d)' % i, self.cpuclass)
        self.o.cpu[i].processor_number = get_next_cpu_number()
        self.o.cpu[i].mmu = self.o.mmu[i]
        self.o.cpu[i].control_registers = [['mid', i]]
        self.o.cpu[i].freq_mhz = self.freq_mhz
</pre>
<p>
After instantiation, the <tt>o</tt> namespace will contain references to the
newly created Simics configuration objects instead.
<p>

<a name="label312"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.3.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing Connection Information</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
For each connector, some information must be supplied to the other component of
the connection. This usually includes a configuration object that implements a
Simics interface, which is needed by some configuration object in the other
component. The information is stored in the <tt><a name="label313">connector_info</a></tt>
data member of the component, and passed to the other component in the call to
its connect method. The <tt>connector_info</tt> dictionary is indexed by
connector name. This dictionary should be filled in by the
<b><i><a name="label314">add_connector_info()</a></i></b> method that is called directly after
<b><i>add_objects()</i></b>, and is also called when restoring an instantiated
component from a checkpoint.
<p>
The format of the values in the connector_info dictionary is a list in the
common case. It may be a tuple as well, described in
<a class="jdocu" href="#label322">12.3.10</a>. The length of the list, and the types
of the values, depends on the kind of the connector. The up and the down part
of a connector may have different arguments in the list.
<p>
At instantiation, any pre-configuration references in <tt>connect_info</tt>
will be converted to configuration object references.
<p>
A dual-function PCI device with two SCSI controllers may have the following
<b><i>add_connector_info()</i></b> method. The first controller is implemented
by configuration object <tt>sym0</tt> and the second by <tt>sym1</tt>.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
def add_connector_info(self):
    self.connector_info['pci-bus'] = [[[0, self.o.sym0], [1, self.o.sym1]]]
    self.connector_info['scsi-bus0'] = [self.o.sym0, 7]
    self.connector_info['scsi-bus1'] = [self.o.sym1, 7]
</pre>
<p>
For the <tt>pci-bus</tt> connector type, the argument is a list with PCI
function number and object implementing the <tt>PCI_DEVICE_INTERFACE</tt>
interface. The <tt>scsi-bus</tt> connector type have two arguments, the object
implementing the <tt>SCSI_TARGET_INTERFACE</tt> and the initial SCSI ID
of the component on the SCSI bus.
<p>

<a name="label315"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.3.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connection Methods</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
For each connector type that a component implements, it must also have a
corresponding <b><i>connect_&lt;connection-type&gt;()</i></b> method.
<p>
<a name="label316"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguments</h5 class="jdocu">

<p>

<p>
The first argument (excluding the Python <tt>self</tt> reference) to the
connect method is the name of the connector. The following arguments come
from the <tt><a name="label317">connector_info</a></tt> list of the other component in the
connection. The connector method typically sets attributes in the objects of
the component that are related to the connection.
<p>
In the example in the previous section, the <tt>connector_info</tt> for an
up-directed <tt>pci-bus</tt> connector in a PCI device was shown. The
corresponding connect method in the component that has a down-directed
<tt>pci-bus</tt> connector may look like the following. The component in the
example has four <tt>pci-bus</tt> connectors, called <tt>pci-slot0</tt>, etc.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
def add_connector_info(self):
    for i in range(4):
        self.connector_info['pci-slot%d' % i] = [i, self.o.pcibus]

def connect_pci_bus(self, connector, device_list):
    slot = self.connector_info[connector][0]
    bus = self.connector_info[connector][1]
    for dev in device_list:
        bus.pci_devices += [[slot, dev[0], dev[1]]]
</pre>
This method first reads some data for the components own connector, to know
what PCI <tt>slot</tt> and <tt>bus</tt> object it has associated with the
connector. It then iterates over <tt>device_list</tt>, that is the list with
PCI functions and objects from the previous example. This list, together with
the PCI slot number, is used to set the <tt>pci_devices</tt> attribute in the
bus object.
<p>
A connect method should make as few assumptions as possible about the objects
that are passed to it. This makes it easier for developers to add new
components that use the same standard connector definitions, so that they can
be connected to existing components.
<p>

<a name="label318"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method Invocation Time</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
The connect methods are called when the components are instantiated, and not
when the CLI command <b>&lt;component&gt;.connect</b>, or
<b>connect-components</b>, is invoked. This simplifies coding
the connect methods, since they are only called once, and implementing 
disconnection of components before instantiation is simpler.
<p>

<a name="label319"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method Invocation Order</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
The connect methods are called starting from the top-level component and
working down the hierarchy. The connect method in the lower component of a
connection is called while traversing down the hierarchy downwards. When the
leaves have been reached, the connect methods are called in reverse order
back up the hierarchy. This way components may pass data down the hierarchy
which can be used to by lower components to determine what data to pass up the
hierarchy.
<p>

<a name="label320"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.9.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connect Failures</h5 class="jdocu">


A connect method may not fail. If a connection isn't possible, it should be
prevented by the standard connector mechanisms, such as connector type and
direction checking. In cases where this isn't enough, it is also possible to
have a connector check method that is called before the connect method. This is
described in section <a class="jdocu" href="#label322">12.3.10</a>.

<a name="label321"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.9.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotplug Support</h5 class="jdocu">


For connectors that support hotplugging, there must also be a disconnect
method. It is similar to the connect method, but only takes the connector name
as argument. This method should restore all object attributes related to the
connection to their initial state. To properly support hotplugging, the connect
and disconnect methods also have to handle the case of objects in the
<tt>o</tt> namespace being real Simics configuration objects and not
pre-configuration ones.
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Components may only be connected to other components sharing the same
instantiation state, i.e., instantiated components may only be connected to
other instantiated components, and non-instantiated components may only be
connected to other non-instantiated components.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>

<p>

<a name="label322"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.3.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disallowing Connections</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
Sometimes the generic connector mechanism does not provide sufficient support
for determining when a connection is allowed or not. For example, it may
require device specific knowledge. To solve this, the component may have a
check method that, unlike the connect method, is called when the connect
command is invoked. The check method is called with the same arguments as the
connect method by default. Optionally the other component may supply a tuple
of two different argument lists. Then the first list is supplied to the connect
method, and the second list to the check method.
<p>
Check methods are often used for connectors that support multiple connections,
i.e. they have the <tt>multi</tt> attribute set to <tt>True</tt>. One example
is the ISA bus component that has a <a name="label323">multi-connector</a> where the check
method makes sure that ports of the attached devices do not collide.
<p>
If a check method determines that a connection is not allowed, it should raise
a Python exception with a message saying why the connection failed.
<p>

<a name="label324"></a><h4 class="jdocu">12.3.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naming of Configuration Objects</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
Components set the names of configuration objects when the corresponding
<b>pre_obj</b> object is created, for example:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
self.o.cpu = pre_obj('cpu', 'x86-p2')
</pre>
The <b>x86-p2</b> processor object will get the name <b>cpu</b>
unless there already exist another object with the same name. In that case, an
underscore and a unique number will be appended to the name, for example
<b>cpu_0</b> for the first duplicate and <b>cpu_1</b> for the second.
<p>
<a name="label325"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.11.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic Object Name Numbering</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
The component can decide where in the name the unique number should appear by
including a <tt>$</tt> sign in the name. Underscores are not added in that case.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
self.o.cpu = pre_obj('cpu$', 'x86-p2')
self.o.tlb = pre_obj('cpu$_tlb', 'x86-tlb')
</pre>
The first set of objects created by this code will be called <b>cpu0</b>
and <b>cpu0_tlb</b>, and the second <b>cpu1</b> and
<b>cpu1_tlb</b>. As with the <tt>_&lt;number&gt;</tt> suffix, the number for
the name is assigned when the <b>pre_obj</b> object is created.
<p>

<a name="label326"></a><h5 class="jdocu">12.3.11.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User-defined Object Name Numbering</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
In some cases, a simple automatic numbering of objects is not sufficient, but
object names are still unknown at creation time. A typical example is a large
server with processor boards and a backplane, where processors should be
numbered depending on what slot of the backplane the processor
board is connected to. The component system solves this by allowing simple
parentheses-enclosed expressions in the object name, where <tt>x</tt> is
replaced with a supplied value. This expression can be re-evaluated at anytime
until the component is instantiated, by calling the
<b><i><a name="label327">rename_component_objects()</a></i></b> method.
<p>
The following example creates four processors, numbered from 4 up to 7. The
non-evaluated name is <tt>cpu(x + 0)</tt>, <tt>cpu(x + 1)</tt>, etc. When
<b><i>rename_component_objects()</i></b> is called, <tt>x</tt> is replaced by 4,
and the final object names will be <tt>cpu4</tt>, <tt>cpu5</tt>, etc.
<p>
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
for i in range(4):
    self.o.cpu[i] = pre_obj('cpu(x + %d)' % i, 'x86-p2')

self.rename_component_objects('4')
</pre>
