<a name="label99"></a><h3 class="jdocu">5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the Processor Clock Frequency</h3 class="jdocu">


<a name="label100"></a> 
<a name="label101"></a>

<p>
The clock frequency of a simulated processor can be set arbitrarily in
Simics.  This will not affect the actual speed of simulation, but it
will affect the number of instructions that need to be executed for a
certain amount of simulated time to pass.  If your execution only
depends on executing a certain number of instructions, increasing the clock frequency will take
the same amount of host time (but a shorter amount of target
time). However, if there are time based delays of some kind in the simulation,
these will take  longer to execute. 
<p>
At a simulated 1 MHz, one million target instructions will correspond to a
simulated second (assuming the simple default timing of one cycle per
instruction). At 100 MHz, on the other hand, it will take 100 million
target instructions to complete a simulated second. So with a higher clock
frequency, less simulated target time is going to pass for a certain
period of host execution time.
<p>
If Simics is used to emulate an interactive system (especially one
with a graphical user interface) it is a good idea to set the clock
frequency quite low.  Keyboard and mouse inputs events are handled by
periodic interrupts in most operating systems, using a higher clock
frequency will result in longer delays between invocations of periodic
interrupts.  Thus, the simulated system will feel slower in its user
response, and update the mouse cursor position etc. less frequently.
If this is a problem, the best technique for running experiments at a
high clock frequency is to first complete the configuration of the
machine using a low clock frequency.  Save all configuration changes
to a disk diff (like when installing operating systems).  Then change
the configuration to use a higher a clock frequency and reboot the
target machine.
<p>
Note that for a lightly-loaded machine (for example, working at an
interactive prompt on a serial console to an embedded Linux system),
Simics will often execute quickly enough at the real target clock
frequency that there is no need to artifically lower it.

<a name="label103"></a><h3 class="jdocu">5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manually Testing Interrupts</h3 class="jdocu">


Interrupts from the interrupt controller comes in to the Simics PowerPC via
the <tt>simple_interrupt</tt> interface.
To manually trigger an interrupt it is possible issue:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>@conf.cpu0.iface.simple_interrupt.interrupt(conf.cpu0, 0)</b>
</pre>
The command line triggers the interrupt towards the CPU. The seconds
parameter (zero) indicates that this is a normal interrupt. 
Critical interrupts should use the value 1.
The external interrupt will only be serviced (when continuing execution) if the
MSR[EE] bit is set, enabling external interrupts. 
To manually set this bit issue:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>%msr = %msr | 1&lt;&lt;15</b>
</pre>
To lower the external interrupt manually issue:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
simics&gt; <b>@conf.cpu0.iface.simple_interrupt.interrupt_clear(conf.cpu0, 0)</b>
</pre>
<a name="label104"></a><h3 class="jdocu">5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cache Simulation</h3 class="jdocu">


For generic information on how cache simulation is done in Simics please refer to Simics User Guide.
<p>
PowerPC instructions which manipulates the cache directly, such as <tt>dcbf</tt>
can effect the cache model provided that the processor's <tt>icache</tt> and <tt>dcache</tt>
are properly set.
<p>
The <tt>icache</tt> and <tt>dcache</tt> attributes should point to g-cache objects
simulating instruction and data cache. For SMP configurations, the <tt>cpu_group</tt>
attribute should point to a ppc-broadcast-bus object which will be informed about
the caches the cpus uses. If the WIMG M-bit is set for a cache transaction, then
memory coherency is required and the cache operation is sent down to the broadcast
bus which distributes it to all known caches. For non-SMP configurations or if the
M-bit is not set, the local cache is called directly.
<p>
The following operations are supported:
<p>
<table>
<tr><td class="jdocu_noborder"><b>PowerPC operation</b></td><td class="jdocu_noborder"><b>Cache Operation</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="jdocu_noborder">dcbf (data cache block flush)</td><td class="jdocu_noborder">Cache_Control_Invalidate_Line</td></tr>
<tr><td class="jdocu_noborder">dcbst (data cache block store)</td><td class="jdocu_noborder">Cache_Control_Copyback_Line</td></tr>
<tr><td class="jdocu_noborder">dcbt (data cache block touch)</td><td class="jdocu_noborder">Cache_Control_Fetch_Line</td></tr>
<tr><td class="jdocu_noborder">dcbtst (data cache block touch for store)</td><td class="jdocu_noborder">Cache_Control_Fetch_Line</td></tr>
<tr><td class="jdocu_noborder">HID0[DCFI]</td><td class="jdocu_noborder">Cache_Control_Invalidate_Cache</td></tr>
<tr><td class="jdocu_noborder">HID0[ICFI]</td><td class="jdocu_noborder">Cache_Control_Invalidate_Cache</td></tr>
</table>
Other operations, such as locking cache lines, are not currently supported.
The cache module receives the the cache operation via the cache_control interface.
