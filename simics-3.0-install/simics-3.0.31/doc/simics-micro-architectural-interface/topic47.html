<dt class="jdocu_descitem">DESCRIPTION</dt><dd>
This function advances the instruction <i>ii</i> to the
   next stop phase as set by
   <b><i>SIM_instruction_set_stop_phase</i></b>.
<p>
   The defined phases are the following:
<p>
   
   
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">typedef enum instruction_phase {
        Sim_Phase_Initiated,
        Sim_Phase_Fetched,
        Sim_Phase_Decoded,
        Sim_Phase_Executed,
        Sim_Phase_Retired,
        Sim_Phase_Committed,
        Sim_Phases
} instruction_phase_t;</pre>

   <p>
   For convenience there are some predefined functions that can be
   used to proceed to the phases above. 
<p>
   <b><i>SIM_instruction_fetch(id)</i></b> will proceed to Sim_Phase_Fetch.
 <p>
   <b><i>SIM_instruction_decode(id)</i></b> will proceed to Sim_Phase_Decoded.
 <p>
   <b><i>SIM_instruction_execute(id)</i></b> will proceed to Sim_Phase_Executed.
<p>
   <b><i>SIM_instruction_retire(id)</i></b> will proceed to Sim_Phase_Retired.
 <p>
   <b><i>SIM_instruction_commit(id)</i></b> will proceed to Sim_Phase_Committed.
<p>
   Fetching an instruction means that the memory used by the instruction is
   loaded. This may stall the CPU and <b><i>SIM_instruction_proceed</i></b> will
   signal this by returning <tt>Sim_IE_Stalling</tt>. The instruction can
   then be proceeded to the next phase as soon as the stalling period is over
   (see <b><i>SIM_instruction_remaining_stall_time</i></b>).
<p>
   To fetch an instruction a valid program counter is needed. The
   value of the program counter is read from the register bank for the
   first instruction in the tree and for instructions not inserted in
   the tree. For instructions that have an executed parent the program
   counter will have the value produced by the
   parent. <b><i>SIM_instruction_write_input_reg</i></b> can also be used
   to explicitly set the program counter. This is the only way to
   fetch instructions whose parent has not yet executed and thus not
   produced a new program counter. This will also mark the instruction
   as speculative. As soon as the parent instruction is executed the
   child will become non-speculative again if the produced value
   matches the one set (if the parent was non-speculative). For
   miss-matches we will get a speculative instructions that needs
   to be squashed.
<p>
   All the above also apply to the next program counter if the
   architecture has delay slots.
<p>
   When an instruction is fetched <b><i>SIM_instruction_opcode</i></b> can
   be used to retrieve the opcode.
<p>
   Decoding means interpreting the fetched data and translate it to a
   determined instruction. It is then possible to use
   <b><i>SIM_instruction_type</i></b> to determine the type of the
   instruction and <b><i>SIM_instruction_get_reg_info</i></b> to find the
   registers used by the instruction.
<p>
   Executing an instruction means that the actual operation is
   performed. Thus input values are used to produce output values. The
   input values used are collected from previously executed
   instructions (or the register bank) and the output values will be
   available for later instructions. Simics has no restrictions on the
   number of temporal values that can exists between instruction. This
   can be viewed as an unlimited resource of internal registers for
   register renaming.
<p>
   To be able to execute the instruction all the input values must
   have been produced, i.e. all dependences must be fulfilled. This
   is done either by executing all instructions that the instruction
   depends on or explicitly set the value of an input register by
   using <b><i>SIM_instruction_write_input_reg</i></b>. As with the
   program counter above the latter case will also make the
   instruction speculative until an earlier instruction produces the
   same value. This is how value speculation can be handled.
<p>
   <tt>Sim_IE_Unresolved_Dependences</tt> will be returned if an
   instruction is not ready for execution.
<p>
   Instructions that access memory may stall and
   <tt>Sim_EI_Stalling</tt> will be returned. As with
   instruction fetches the instruction can be proceeded again as soon
   as the stalling period is over.
<p>
   Retiring an instruction sends all speculative stores to memory. The
   instruction must be non-speculative to enter this phase. The instruction may
   stall since the stores are sent to the memory hierarchy. The instruction may
   also get an exception (like a memory parity error). Retiring an instruction
   can be done out-of-order.
<p>
   When committing an instruction the output values produced by the
   instruction are copied to the register bank.  The instruction is
   automatically removed from the instruction tree, but it must be
   deallocated explicitly by calling <b><i>SIM_instruction_end</i></b>.
   Instructions marked as speculative cannot be committed. This can be
   forced by the user by calling
   <b><i>SIM_instruction_force_correct</i></b> to remove the speculative
   status before committing. This is strongly discouraged since it may
   lead to incorrect execution.  Also, the instruction may only have one valid
   execution path left, all alternative branches have to be squashed
   before the instruction can be committed.
<p>
   Certain return values needs special actions to be taken. If some of
   the functions returns <tt>Sim_IE_Exception</tt> an exception
   occurred and the execution of the instruction is aborted. The
   exception should be handled by calling
   <b><i>SIM_instruction_handle_exception</i></b> on the faulting
   instruction. This call will set the program counter to the first
   instruction in the corresponding exception handler.
<p>
   If <tt>Sim_IE_Speculative</tt> is returned it means a
   speculative instruction tried to commit. 
<p>
   If <tt>Sim_IE_Sync_Instruction</tt> is returned it means that
   a synchronizing instruction was executed in a speculative
   state. Synchronizing instructions have to be executed in
   non-speculative state since they cannot be squashed.</dd>
