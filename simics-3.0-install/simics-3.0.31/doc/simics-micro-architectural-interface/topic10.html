<h3 class="jdocu">4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proceeding Instructions</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
<a name="label115"></a>
So far our instruction tree contains only empty instruction data
structures. <b><i><a name="label116">SIM_instruction_proceed</a></i></b> is used both to
initialize these data structures and to move the instruction between
the phases of instruction operation. The defined instruction phases
are: initiated, fetched, decoded, executed, retired, and
committed. More phases may be added in the future. These phases do not
map directly to a modern processor pipeline but define the atomic
phases an instruction can be broken down to inside Simics. Somewhere
along the pipeline an instruction need to pass through some or all
of these phases.
<p>
The user can define which phases to proceed to by calling
<b><i><a name="label117">SIM_instruction_set_stop_phase</a></i></b>. This function takes a phase
and a boolean value. <b><i><a name="label118">SIM_instruction_proceed</a></i></b> will then stop
after the next phase that is set to true.  For convenience there are
predefined functions that combine setting a stop phase and
proceeding. These shortcuts are: <b><i><a name="label119">SIM_instruction_fetch</a></i></b>,
<b><i><a name="label120">SIM_instruction_decode</a></i></b>, 
<b><i><a name="label121">SIM_instruction_execute</a></i></b>,
<b><i><a name="label122">SIM_instruction_retire</a></i></b>, and
<b><i><a name="label123">SIM_instruction_commit</a></i></b>.
<p>
Instructions can be proceeded to the decoded phase before they are
inserted in the instruction tree, this is useful if the tree location
for a decoded instruction depends on its type (the type of an
instruction can be determined when it is decoded). For example the
instruction following a delay slot have a different parent depending
on whether the delay slot is annulled or not.
<p>
<a name="label124"></a><h4 class="jdocu">4.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fetch Phase</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
<a name="label125"></a><a name="label126"></a>
During the fetch phase an instruction is copied from memory into the
internal instruction data structures created by
<b><i><a name="label127">SIM_instruction_insert</a></i></b>. As this is a memory operation, any
memory hierarchy attached to Simics will be called during the
phase. The memory hierarchy may indicate that the memory access should
stall the CPU. If this occurs <b><i><a name="label128">SIM_instruction_proceed</a></i></b> or
its shortcuts will return a status value to notify the caller about
this.  <b><i><a name="label129">SIM_instruction_remaining_stall_time</a></i></b> will return the
number of cycles remaining. Once the stall has completed
<b><i><a name="label130">SIM_instruction_remaining_stall_time</a></i></b> will return zero and
the instruction can be proceeded to the next phase. If
<b><i><a name="label131">SIM_instruction_proceed</a></i></b> or any of its shortcuts is called
before the stall time has completed they will return the same status
value again.
<p>
Fetching an instruction may also generate an exception. In this case
another status value is returned. Exception handling is described in section
<a class="jdocu" href="#label169">4.3.6</a>.
<p>
A <a name="label132">program counter</a> value is necessary to fetch an
instruction. Simics can look for the value in several places. If the
instruction is at the head of the instruction tree or not yet inserted
in the tree, Simics will read the <a name="label133">architectural state</a>. For
instructions at other locations in the tree, Simics will look in the
output of the parent instruction. If the parent has not reached the
executed phase the program counter output field will be invalid and
the instruction will not be able to proceed to fetched. However the
user can also override the default program counter value with the
function <b><i><a name="label134">SIM_instruction_write_input_reg</a></i></b>. This
is the only way to fetch instructions whose parent has not yet
executed. This will also mark the instruction as
speculative<a name="label135"></a>. As soon as the parent
instruction is executed the child will become non-speculative if the
produced value of the program counter matches the one set (if the
parent was non-speculative). When the written program counter does not
match the generated program counter the instruction is incorrect and
will eventually need to be discarded. See section <a class="jdocu" href="topic11.html#label180">4.4</a>.
<p>
When simulating the SPARC architecture the above applies to
<a name="label136">nPC</a> as well.
<p>
When an instruction is fetched <b><i><a name="label137">SIM_instruction_opcode</a></i></b> can
be used to retrieve the opcode.
<a name="label138"></a><h4 class="jdocu">4.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decode Phase</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
<a name="label139"></a><a name="label140"></a>
During the decode phase Simics translates the fetched instruction into
the internal data structures that are used during execution. It is
then possible to use <b><i><a name="label141">SIM_instruction_type</a></i></b> to determine the
type of the instruction and <b><i><a name="label142">SIM_instruction_get_reg_info</a></i></b> to
find the registers used by the instruction. These registers can then
be read and written with <b><i><a name="label143">SIM_instruction_read_input_reg</a></i></b> and
<b><i><a name="label144">SIM_instruction_write_input_reg</a></i></b>.
<p>
Under special circumstances the instruction cannot be decoded until
the value of a certain register that determines the instruction is
known. For example on the SPARC architecture the value of the asi
register can change the instruction from a normal memory operation
into a <a name="label145">block operation</a>. In this case
<b><i><a name="label146">SIM_instruction_proceed</a></i></b> and
<b><i><a name="label147">SIM_instruction_decode</a></i></b> will return an error code until the
value of the asi register is known.
<p>
<a name="label148"></a><h4 class="jdocu">4.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Execution Phase</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
<a name="label149"></a><a name="label150"></a> Instruction semantics
are modeled during the execution phase. Thus <a name="label151">input values</a>
are used to produce <a name="label152">output values</a>. The input values used
are collected from previously executed instructions by reading from
the pool of internal registers or from the architectural register
state. The output values are written to the internal registers. As
stated before Simics has no restrictions on the number of internal
registers.
<p>
Before an instruction can execute all the input values must have been
produced, i.e. all dependences must be fulfilled. This is done either
by executing all instructions that the instruction depends on or by
explicitly setting the value of an input register with
<b><i><a name="label153">SIM_instruction_write_input_reg</a></i></b>. As with the program
counter the latter case will also make the instruction speculative
until an earlier instruction produces the same value. This is how
value speculation can be handled.
<p>
Instructions that access memory may stall if the connected memory
hierarchy returns a stall time. <b><i><a name="label154">SIM_instruction_proceed</a></i></b> and
<b><i><a name="label155">SIM_instruction_execute</a></i></b> will then return a status code to
signal this.
<p>
As with the fetch and decode phases, a status code will be returned if
the execution phase does not complete due to an exception.
<p>
<a name="label156"></a><h4 class="jdocu">4.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retire Phase</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
<a name="label157"></a><a name="label158"></a>
During the Retire phase, all stores that were speculatively executed and kept
in the <a name="label159">LSQ</a> are sent to memory, one by one and in order if the instruction
executed several. 
<p>
Before an instruction can retire it must have become
non-speculative. Retiring stores can be done out-of-order
<a name="label160"></a>since the LSQ will take care of
reordering stores that are conflicting. Note that starting the Retire
phase makes the instruction unsquashable since the <a name="label161">architectural
state</a> will be modified.
<p>
An instruction may stall during the Retire phase since memory operations are
sent to the memory hierarchy. The status codes are the same as for the Execute
phase. A retiring store may trigger an exception (like a memory parity
error). In this case, it will be marked as faulting with status executed.
<p>
<a name="label162"></a><h4 class="jdocu">4.3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commit Phase</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
Instruction output is written back to the <a name="label163">architectural
state</a> during the <a name="label164">commit
phase</a><a name="label165"></a>. When committed, the instruction is
automatically removed from the instruction tree, but the data
structures remain until explicitly deallocated by calling
<b><i><a name="label166">SIM_instruction_end</a></i></b>.  Instructions marked as
speculative cannot be committed. However the user can force
speculative commit by calling
<b><i><a name="label167">SIM_instruction_force_correct</a></i></b> to remove the
speculative status before committing. This is strongly discouraged
since it may lead to incorrect execution. In addition, an instruction
can only be committed if it is at the root of the instruction tree and
it has only one child instruction. The one child limit is to avoid the
creation of two separate instruction trees.
<p>
Committed instructions cannot be discarded since their output have
been copied to <a name="label168">architectural state</a> and thus cannot be rolled back.
<p>
<a name="label169"></a><h4 class="jdocu">4.3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
Exceptions may occur at any phase of instruction
operation. Exceptions are signaled by a return code from
<b><i><a name="label170">SIM_instruction_proceed</a></i></b> or its shortcuts. Once an exception
has been signaled the instruction cannot proceeded to further
phases. The exception should be handled by calling
<b><i><a name="label171">SIM_instruction_handle_exception</a></i></b> on the <a name="label172">faulting
instruction</a>. This call will set the program counter to the first
instruction in the corresponding exception handler.  Currently this
function requires that the instruction tree contains only the faulting
instruction. All earlier instructions must have been committed and all
later instructions need to be discarded. All previous instruction must
be committed as Simics can only service exception handlers in order
and non-speculatively. This cannot be guaranteed unless the instruction
with the exception is the oldest instruction in the tree.
<p>
<a name="label173"></a><h4 class="jdocu">4.3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interrupts</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
<a name="label174"></a>
Interrupts differ from exceptions in that they are inherently
asynchronous. Thus while the handling mechanism is similar the
signaling mechanism is quite different. Simics signals that an
interrupt has occurred by raising an <a name="label175">Asynchronous_Trap</a> hap. The user
must install a handler for this hap. The suggested operation is that
the hap handler set a flag visible to the <a name="label176">cycle handler</a>. Once the
cycle handler is aware of an interrupt it may choose to service the
interrupt by calling <b><i><a name="label177">SIM_instruction_handle_interrupt</a></i></b> at
any time, subject to one restriction - the instruction tree must be
empty. When <b><i><a name="label178">SIM_instruction_handle_interrupt</a></i></b> is called
Simics will cache the current value for the next instruction and
replace it with the address of the first instruction in the <a name="label179">interrupt
vector</a>. When the interrupt completes the cached address will be used
to return control to the interrupted location.
