<h3 class="jdocu">5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generic Cache OOO</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
A special cache model called <b><a name="label239">g-cache-ooo</a></b> is provided with Simics
MAI to handle <a name="label240">multiple outstanding transactions</a> and out-of-order execution. It
is very similar to <b><a name="label241">g-cache</a></b> described in <em>Simics User
Guide</em> so we describe here only the differences that are introduced by
the special MAI requirements.
<p>
Although <b><a name="label242">g-cache</a></b> and <b>g-cache-ooo</b> have a very
similar interface (in terms of attributes and commands), they do not handle
transactions in the same way. Whereas <b>g-cache</b> takes care of a
transactions in one pass, computing all the penalties and performing all the
state changes as the transaction goes through its different phases,
<b>g-cache-ooo</b> tries to present a more credible model for
out-of-order execution. Each phase of a transaction in the cache is considered
and handled separately. A transaction may trigger a copy-back that will last
some cycles, then a fetch will be sent to the next level stalling the cache for
some more cycles, and finally the result will be returned. During these phases,
<b>g-cache-ooo</b> ensures that other transactions behave in a sensible
manner: for example, if two transactions want to fetch the same cache line, the
second transaction is considered as a delayed hit and its value will be
returned when the first (missing) transaction is completed; cache lines are
locked as long as the transaction using them is on-going.
<p>
<b>g-cache-ooo</b> supports the same options as <b>g-cache</b>
except:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li><a name="label243">MESI</a> is not implemented.</li>
<p>
<li>There is no <i>penalty_read_next</i> and
<i>penalty_write_next</i> attributes. You should connect a next level
memory hierarchy if you want transactions to the next level to stall
longer. The <b>trans-staller</b> module can be used to set a simple
delay.</li>
<p>
<li><b>g-cache-ooo</b> can not use the STCs <a name="label244"></a>to
get improve the speed of the simulation.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
Some new, MAI specific features have been introduced:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>The attributes <i><a name="label245">config_read_per_cycle</a></i> and
<i><a name="label246">config_write_per_cycle</a></i> limit the number of read and write
transactions that can be initiated in the cache for a given cycle.</li>
<p>
<li>The attributes <i><a name="label247">config_max_out_trans</a></i> limits the number of
outstanding transactions that can be present in the cache.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<b>g-cache-ooo</b> can be used with any Simics configuration, even
without MAI. However, since it relies quite heavily on the ability to stall
transactions to handle state changes, only stallable transactions are
considered cacheable. If you want to warm-up your caches with a normal run and
wish to include transactions that are normally not stallable (and thus not
cacheable) like x86 instruction fetches, you should:
<p>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Set all penalties in your memory hierarchy to 0.</li>
<p>
<li>Set the attribute <i><a name="label248">config_accept_no_stall</a></i> to 1 to tell the
cache to accept non-stallable transactions.</li>
<p>
</ol>
