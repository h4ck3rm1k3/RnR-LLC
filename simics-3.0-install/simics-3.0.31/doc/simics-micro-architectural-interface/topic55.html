<dt class="jdocu_descitem">DESCRIPTION</dt><dd>
Returns the instruction status of the instruction identified by
   <i>ii</i>. <tt>instruction_status_t</tt> is a bit field
   of the following values:
   <p>
   <tt>Sim_IS_Ready</tt> means that the instruction have all its
   input ready and can be executed (for the first time or after a stalling period), 
   <tt>Sim_IS_Waiting</tt> means that the instruction is waiting for its dependences to be ready,
   <tt>Sim_IS_Stalling</tt> indicates that the instruction is stalling and does not have its output ready, 
   <tt>Sim_IS_Faulting</tt> means that the instruction has raised an exception,
   <tt>Sim_IS_Trap</tt> on x86 means that the instruction has raised a trap,
   <tt>Sim_IS_Interrupt</tt> on x86 means that the interrupt received must be handled before executing further instructions,
   see SIM_instruction_phase),
   <tt>Sim_IS_Branch_Taken</tt> means that the branch was taken for a branch instruction.
<p>
   If both <tt>Sim_IS_Stalling</tt> and
   <tt>Sim_IS_Ready</tt> are set it indicates that the instruction has
   completed its stalling period and needs to be executed (proceeded)
   again to make another call to the memory hierarchy, which this time
   presumably will "unstall" the instruction.</dd>
