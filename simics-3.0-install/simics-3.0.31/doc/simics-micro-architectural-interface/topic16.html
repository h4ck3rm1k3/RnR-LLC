<p>
<a name="label221"></a><a name="label222"></a><a name="label223"></a>There is a memory locking mechanism implemented for atomic
instructions that prevents processors in a multi-processor system from
breaking atomic properties. An atomic instruction typically consists
of a load and a store part that must be performed without any
intervening conflicting transactions. MAI handles this by locking a
ram region at a configurable granularity when the first access is
issued. The lock is released as soon as the second access is finished
or if the instruction is squashed. Any conflicting transaction to the
same memory region issued between the two by any processor will stall
until the lock is released. The granularity can be set in each ram
object to control the size of a region. If the size is set to 0 no
locking will be performed and it is then up to the timing model to
handle the locking.  The default granularity is set to 8 bytes.
