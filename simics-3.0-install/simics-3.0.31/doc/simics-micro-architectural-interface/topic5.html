<h3 class="jdocu">3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dependences</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
An out-of-order CPU core needs to keep track of all <a name="label24">dependences</a> in the
instruction stream so that instructions do not get executed in the wrong
order. We describe below the different types of dependences and how Simics
handles them.

Figure <a class="jdocu" href="#label38">1</a> shows three types of dependences, <a name="label31"></a>
<a name="label32">read-after-write</a> (<a name="label33">RAW</a>), <a name="label34">write-after-read</a>
(<a name="label35">WAR</a>) and <a name="label36">write-after-write</a> (<a name="label37">WAW</a>). We are
using assembly code with the format <i>opcode source1, source2,
destination</i>.

<p>
RAW dependences are also called <i>data dependences</i> since there is a flow
of data between the dependent instructions. A data dependence exists between
instruction <i>x</i> and <i>y </i> if <i>y</i> uses a result directly produced
by <i>x</i> or produced by an instruction that has a RAW dependence on
<i>x</i>. Instructions with RAW dependences can not be reordered. Simics will
ensure that RAW dependences are followed and will refuse to execute
instructions that did not receive all the input they needed (although the user
may also speculate on the input values, thus fulfilling this requirement).
<p>
WAR and WAW dependences are sometimes called <em>anti-dependences</em> or
<em>name dependences</em> since the two instructions use the same resource but
there is no flow of data between them. A name dependence exists if:
<a name="label39"></a><a name="label40"></a>
<a name="label41"></a><a name="label42"></a>
<ul>
<p>
<li>Instruction <i>x</i> reads a register or memory location that instruction
<i>y</i> writes to or</li>
<p>
<li>Instruction <i>x</i> writes to a register or memory location that
instruction <i>y</i> also writes to.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
Instruction WAW and WAR dependences can be reordered by allocating more
resources to their execution. In the WAW case, the CPU could write to an
internal register %r0 instead of %g4, thus removing the resource conflict and
the dependence. This is commonly called register renaming. Simics has the
capability to handle all anti-dependences by using an unlimited pool of
internal registers.<a name="label43"></a><a name="label44"></a>
<p>
<a name="label45"></a><h5 class="jdocu">3.1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPARC-V9</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
Simics MAI for SPARC-V9 can rename the following registers:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>All general purpose registers, i.e. %g1 - %g7, %o0 - %o7, %l0- %l7, and %i0
- %i7. %g0 does not introduce any dependence since it always reads as
zero.</li>
<p>
<li>The register window state registers, i.e. %cwp, %cansave, %canrestore,
%otherwin, and %cleanwin.</li>
<p>
<li>The integer condition code register %ccr.</li>
<p>
<li>The multiply and divide register %y.</li>
<p>
<li>All floating-point registers, %f0 - %f63. They are treated as single
entities, e.g. if an instruction is using a quad register for input it will
depend on four separate single precision registers.</li>
<p>
<li>The fcc0, fcc1, fcc2, fcc3, ftt, aexc, and cexc parts of the floating-point
state register %fsr.</li>
<p>
<li>The floating point register state register %fprs.</li>
<p>
<li>The graphic status register %gsr.</li>
<p>
<li>The alternate space identifier register %asi.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
Instructions accessing other registers need to be synchronized and
cannot run out of order. See section <a class="jdocu" href="topic12.html#label189">4.5</a> 
for more information.
<p>

<a name="label46"></a><h5 class="jdocu">3.1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x86</h5 class="jdocu">


<p>
Simics MAI for x86 can rename the following registers:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESP, EBP, ESI and EDI.</li>
<p>
<li>MMX registers.</li>
<p>
<li>XMM registers.</li>
<p>
<li>EFlags register.</li>

Instructions accessing other registers need to be synchronized and
cannot run out of order. See section <a class="jdocu" href="topic12.html#label189">4.5</a> 
for more information.
<p>
Note that the list does not include the x87 FPU that uses a stack model to
represent floating-point registers. All x87 FPU instructions are currently
synchronized.

<p>
Figure <a class="jdocu" href="#label49">2</a> is an example of <a name="label50">control
dependence</a><a name="label51"></a>: a conditional branch
instruction before an add instruction. The add cannot be executed
unless the branch target is known. Control dependences can be avoided
by speculating on the execution path. In Simics MAI control
dependences are handled by speculating on the Program Counter register
(PC or IP depending on the architecture). Instructions that have been
fetched with a speculative PC are marked as "speculative". The
speculative status will be removed as soon as the control path is
known. If a speculative instruction was incorrectly executed, it has
to be squashed before the execution can continue.
<p>
<a name="label52"></a><h4 class="jdocu">3.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memory Dependences</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
<a name="label53"></a> <a name="label54"></a> Memory
data dependences are handled by an internal <a name="label55">load-store queue</a> (LSQ) and
an optional <a name="label56">consistency controller</a>. The <a name="label57">LSQ</a>
handles <a name="label58">self-consistency</a> (i.e. ensures that program order
consistency is fulfilled) and the consistency controller handles
memory consistency for multiprocessor systems.
<p>
When a store is executed, the transaction is placed in a <a name="label59">store
queue</a> without being issued to memory. When the store instruction
becomes non-speculative, the store operation can be retired and sent
to memory. Speculative loads are matched against the LSQ before being
sent to memory to ensure that they load the current (and possibly
speculative) value of the memory area they access.
<p>
The LSQ will also make sure that stores are never committed out of order if
they conflict and that loads cannot execute if there is a risk of conflict with
a non-executed previous store.
<p>
The size of the LSQ is unlimited. It is up to the user module to place
restrictions on the number of outstanding stores.
<p>
The consistency controller is described in section <a class="jdocu" href="topic17.html#label225">5.3</a>.
