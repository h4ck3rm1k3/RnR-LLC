<h3 class="jdocu">4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synchronous Instructions</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
Simics does not currently have the ability to rename all architectural
state, thus there are a limited number of instructions that write to
the <a name="label190">architectural state</a> immediately. These instructions are called
<a name="label191">synchronous instructions</a><a name="label192"></a> as they must be run
synchronously. <b><i><a name="label193">SIM_instruction_is_sync</a></i></b> can be used to
determine if an instruction is synchronous.  These instructions need
to be executed non-speculatively and when all earlier instructions in
the tree have been executed or committed. This is to ensure that the
immediate changes to the <a name="label194">architectural state</a> caused by the instruction
are never incorrect. If a synchronous instruction is executed in an
illegal way <b><i><a name="label195">SIM_instruction_proceed</a></i></b> will return an error code.
<p>
Note that this is a Simics limitation and not an architectural
limitation.  In appendix <a class="jdocu" href="topic58.html#label416">B</a> and
appendix <a class="jdocu" href="topic59.html#label417">C</a> all synchronous instructions
are listed for SPARC and x86 respectively.
