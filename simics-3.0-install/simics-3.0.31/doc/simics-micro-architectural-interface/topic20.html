<h2 class="jdocu">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Started with SPARC-V9 MAI</h2 class="jdocu">
  

<p>
There are a number of pre-configured setups included in the Simics distribution
that uses the MAI to simulate out-of-order processors. They are all examples on
how to use the API in different ways. The scripts reside in the same directory
as the ordinary Simics scrips for a specific target. The name of the scripts
contains <tt>ooo</tt> (for <em>out-of-order</em>). Here follows a short
description of each script and how they can be further configured:
<p>
<ul>
<li><tt>simics/targets/sunfire/bagle-ooo-common.simics</tt></li>
<li><tt>simics/targets/sunfire/donut-ooo-common.simics</tt></li>
<li><tt>simics/targets/serengeti/sarek-ooo-common.simics</tt>
<p>
These scripts uses the module <b><a name="label255">ooo-micro-arch</a></b> (see
the source code in <tt>simics/src/extensions/ooo-micro-arch</tt>) to
demonstrate how MAI works. The model can fetch, execute, and commit a
configurable number of instructions per cycle. No branch speculation is
performed, thus if an unresolved branch is found the fetches are stalled until
the outcome of the branch is determined.
<p>
If an exception occurs the instruction tree is drained and all the
speculative instructions beyond the one that caused the exception are
discarded.
<p>
A pipeline is modeled with a combined fetch/decode stage, an execute
state, and a commit stage.
<p>
Each processor gets an object of the <b><a name="label256">ooo_micro_arch</a></b>
class attached to it that handles the simulation. These objects have
some attributes that can be changed to alter the behavior of the
model:
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>&lt;ooo_micro_arch&gt;.<a name="label257">fetches_per_cycles</a></i> controls
the number of instructions that can be fetched and decoded per
cycle. Default is 1.</li>
<p>
<li><i>&lt;ooo_micro_arch&gt;.<a name="label258">execute_per_cycles</a></i> controls
the number of instructions that can be executed per cycle. The
instructions can be dependent of each other. Default is 1.</li>
<p>
<li><i>&lt;ooo_micro_arch&gt;.<a name="label259">commits_per_cycles</a></i> controls
how many instructions that can be committed per cycle. Default is
1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
<li><tt>simics/targets/sunfire/bagle-ma-common.simics</tt></li>
<li><tt>simics/targets/sunfire/donut-ma-common.simics</tt></li>
<li><tt>simics/targets/serengeti/sarek-ma-common.simics</tt>
<p>
These scripts use the <b><a name="label260">sample-micro-arch</a></b> module (see
<tt>simics/src/extensions/sample-micro-arch</tt>). The processors modeled
can fetch/decode, execute, and commit a configurable number of instructions per
cycle.
<p>
The model has a simple branch-predictor that uses a hash table (<a name="label261">Branch
Target Buffer</a><a name="label262"></a>) to lookup the target address from the
address of the branch instruction. This allows for <a name="label263">branch
speculation</a>. The hash table is updated for every successfully committed
branch.
<p>
Besides speculating on the target address, the model also speculate
fall through for every branch. This way two possible execution paths
are created for every branch.  This makes the instruction tree into a
binary tree. The number of instructions executed and fetch per cycle
is actually per branch in the instruction tree.
<p>
There is a compile time switch available called <a name="label264"></a>
<tt>VALUE_PREDICTION</tt> that can be defined to switch on value prediction of
loads. It works like a small cache that maps logical addresses to values. When
a load is issued, the cache is looked up first to quickly get value that can be
used by later instructions. When the load is finished the speculated value is
checked against the real value. If they mismatch, the later instructions need
to be squashed.
<p>
Each processor gets an object of the <b><a name="label265">sample_micro_arch</a></b>
class attached to it that handles the simulation. The class implements
the following attributes:
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>&lt;sample_micro_arch&gt;.<a name="label266">fetches_per_cycles</a></i> controls
the number of instructions that can be fetched and decoded per
cycle. Default is 4.</li>
<p>
<li><i>&lt;sample_micro_arch&gt;.<a name="label267">execute_per_cycles</a></i> controls
the number of instructions that can be executed per cycle. The
instructions can be dependent of each other. Default is 4.</li>
<p>
<li><i>&lt;sample_micro_arch&gt;.<a name="label268">retires_per_cycles</a></i> controls
how many stores that can be retired to memory per cycle. Default is
4.</li>
<p>
<li><i>&lt;sample_micro_arch&gt;.<a name="label269">commits_per_cycles</a></i> controls
how many instructions that can be committed per cycle. Default is
4.</li>
<p>
<li><i>&lt;sample_micro_arch&gt;.<a name="label270">out_of_order_retire</a></i>. If
non-zero the retire phase can be performed out of order. Default is
0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
The following attributes in each CPU object can also be used
to further configure the models:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li><i>&lt;processor&gt;.<a name="label271">reorder_buffer_size</a></i> controls
the total number of instructions that fit in the instruction tree.</li>
<p>
<li><i>&lt;processor&gt;.<a name="label272">auto_speculate_cwp</a></i>. If set to
non-zero the <a name="label273">CWP</a> register is automatically speculated, i.e. if a save
instruction is encountered in the instruction stream the value of the
CWP register will automatically be incremented (modulo the number of
windows) for the following instructions, and if a restore or a return
instruction is found CWP will be decremented automatically.
<p>
</li>
<p>
</ul>
