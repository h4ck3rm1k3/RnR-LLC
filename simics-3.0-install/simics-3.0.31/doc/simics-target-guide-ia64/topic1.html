<p>
<a name="label20"></a><h3 class="jdocu">2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
Simics/IA64-460GX models machines based on the Itanium processor (from the
<i>Intel Itanium</i> processor family, also known as <i>IPF</i>. The machines
are based on the Intel 460GX chipset, and may be configured with up to 32
processors. Only Linux is supported as target operating system.

<p>
The Simics/IA64-460GX machine is somewhat similar to the HP i2000 workstation,
also known as "BigSur"). Unlike the HP i2000 workstation, the machine in
Simics can be configured with more than two processors (as long as this is
supported by the target operating system).
<p>
The Intel 460GX chipset supports up to 4-way multiprocessor configurations.
The simulated model of this chipset, however, supports an arbitrary number of
processors. In this case, Linux will support configurations with up to 32
processors.
<p>
The 460GX chipset can be divided into several components, and the simulated
model supports a subset of these components (that will allow Linux to run
unmodified). In particular, parts of the following components are simulated:

The chipset compontents included with Simics/IA64-460GX is only a small subset
of the real 460GX chipset.
