<h2 class="jdocu">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing Simics</h2 class="jdocu">


<p>
Simics is provided as one or several <tt>tar</tt> archive files, for
example <tt>simics-pkg-00-3.0.0-linux.tar</tt> where 00 is a customer
specific package number, and 3.0.0 is the Simics version number. It is
recommended that Simics is installed by <tt>root</tt> in a read-only location,
such as <tt>/opt/virtutech/</tt>. Once Simics is installed, each user can
create a Simics workspace as described in section
<a class="jdocu" href="topic3.html#label26">4</a>.
<p>
<a name="label21"></a><h3 class="jdocu">Installing a Simics Package</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Download the appropriate Simics packages from the download site. (The
download URL and package numbers are distributed separately).</li>
<p>
<li>Unpack all package files by running <tt>tar</tt>.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
$ <b>tar xf simics-pkg-00-3.0.0-linux.tar</b>
</pre>
This will create a temporary installation directory called
<tt>simics-3.0-install</tt>. One Simics base package and several add-on
packages can be installed at the same time, by unpacking them with
<tt>tar</tt> before continuing with the next step, running the install
script. It is possible to install multiple base packages of the same package
type, where only the host type differs, at the same time.
</li>
<p>
<li>Change to the temporary installation directory and run the install script.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
$ <b>su</b>
Password:
# <b>cd simics-3.0-install</b>
# <b>sh install-simics.sh</b>
</pre>
</li>
<p>
<li>The install script will search the current directory for packages to
install and ask for an alternative directory to install Simics in instead of
the default one. It will also ask for the decryption key for each package.
If packages have been unpacked earlier with the same package number and the
same Simics version number, then the decode key has been cached in
<tt>$HOME/.simics-tfkeys</tt>.</li>
<p>
<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> It is not possible to install several Simics base packages in the same
directory.<hr class="jdocu_note">
<p>
<li>When the install script finishes, Simics has been installed in
<tt>/opt/virtutech/simics-&lt;version&gt;/</tt>. This path is referred to as
<tt>[simics]</tt> in all Simics documentation. The <tt>/opt/virtutech/</tt>
path may differ if an alternative installation directory was specified when the
install script was run.</li>
<p>
<li>The temporary installation directory may be removed when Simics has been
successfully installed.</li>
<p>
</ol>

<a name="label22"></a><h3 class="jdocu">Installing the License</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
If you have a node-locked license file, simply copy it to the
<tt>[simics]/licenses/</tt> directory. To install floating licenses, refer
to section <a class="jdocu" href="topic4.html#label29">5</a>.
<p>

<hr class="jdocu_note"><b>Note:</b> Once FLEXlm has successfully checked out a license it will add the path
to the license search path (if it is not already present) in the
<tt>.flexlmrc</tt> file in the user's home directory. If it takes a long
time when Simics checks out the license, check this file for old incorrect
paths to remove.

<a name="label23"></a><h3 class="jdocu">Installing Disk Images</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
A disk image, also called <em>disk dump</em> represents the contents of a hard
disk, usually in a compressed form. Since images can be quite big, they are
not provided in the standard Simics packages, but have to be downloaded
separately. Publicly available image files can be downloaded from the Simics
web site, <a class="jdocu" href="https://www.simics.net/" target="_top">https://www.simics.net/</a>.
<p>

<a name="label24"></a><h4 class="jdocu">3.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single User Environment</h4 class="jdocu">


In single user environments it is usually easiest to keep image files in
the corresponding <tt>[workspace]/targets/&lt;architecture&gt;/</tt> directory.
Simics will automatically look for files in this directory, and images do not
have to be moved when Simics is upgraded.

<a name="label25"></a><h4 class="jdocu">3.0.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi User Environment</h4 class="jdocu">


To allow several users to share the same image files, it is recommended that
images are placed in a shared directory in the file-system, for example in
<tt>/opt/virtutech/images/</tt>. After installing Simics, a reference to this
directory should be added in the installation wide startup file
<tt>[simics]/config/startup-commands</tt>:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
add-directory /opt/virtutech/images/
</pre>
