<h2 class="jdocu">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booting RTEMS</h2 class="jdocu">


The Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems operating system, known as
RTEMS, usually builds and links into a single binary file. This file usually
includes the user application. This mean that booting RTEMS is a fairly simple
task with Simics.
<p>
Booting RTEMS can be acomplished in several ways. One way is to run the regular
PMON firmware and inject the binary in SREC format over the emulated serial port
e.g. by copy-paste to the console window. This method is cumbersome, however.
<p>
A much easier and faster method is to use the PMON emulation that can be accessed
through Simics's Python layer to do the initial firmware set-up, and then
load RTEMS as either an ELF or an SREC file with the load-binary command. After
the file has been loaded, it is possible to execute RTEMS by setting PC?to the
start address provided by the binary.
<p>
RTEMS typically zeros the entire memory area during boot. In order to
avoid repeating this process&#8212;which is completely unnecessary in
Simics and can take some considerable time if the amount of memory is
large&#8212;a checkpoint can be saved after the first boot in order to
avoid repeating this excercise.  
<p>
Another way is to patch the call to <tt>memset</tt> from
<tt>RTEMS_Malloc_Initialize</tt> and turn the call into a <tt>nop</tt>
instruction.  It is also possible to identify when the memory-zeroing
loop starts in the boot process and which register is used as the
counter.  As the following example shows, the register can then be
patched on-the-fly:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
# Load dhrystone binary, skipping memory zeroing
  set-pc (load-binary "rtems-dhrystone.elf")
  c 105089
  %o2 = 16
</pre>
