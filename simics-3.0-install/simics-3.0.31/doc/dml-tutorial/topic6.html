<h3 class="jdocu">2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Simple Device</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
The following DML program is an example of a "smallest device that does
anything interesting":
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  // A very simple device
  dml 1.0;
  device simple_device;
  import "io-memory.dml";

  bank b {
      parameter function = 0;
      register r0 size 4 @0x0000 {
          method read() -&gt; (result) {
              log "info": "Hello, bus!";
              result = 42;
          }
      }
  }
</pre>
This models a memory-mapped device with a single 32-bit (4-byte)
register at offset 0, which upon a read access will return the value 42
as the result of the operation, and as a side effect print a log message
with the text "Hello, bus!" to the Simics console.
<p>
To compile this program, you first need to set up a Simics workspace,
using the <tt>workspace-setup</tt> script (see the <em>Simics
Programming Guide</em> for details). In order to create DML skeleton
files for your new device, you need to pass the flag
<tt>--device=</tt><i>modulename</i><tt></tt> to the script, as follows:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  $ <b>[simics]/bin/workspace-setup --dml=simple_device [home]/workspace</b>
</pre>
(If your workspace directory already exists and you just want to add a
new module, you also need to specify the <tt>--force</tt> flag.) On
Microsoft Windows, using Cygwin, you should use the script called
<tt>[simics]/bin/workspace-setup.bat</tt> instead; also, make sure
you have the default packages of the Cygwin "devel" category installed,
as well as a working MinGW installation, <em>before</em> you try to set
up the workspace; see Section <a class="jdocu" href="topic2.html#label6">1.2</a> for details.
<p>
You will now have a directory <tt>[home]/workspace</tt> containing
(among other things) a GNU Makefile and a subdirectory named
<tt>modules</tt>, which is where your modules are located. Open the
generated skeleton file
<tt>[home]/workspace/modules/simple_device/simple_device.dml</tt> in your
favorite text editor, and modify its contents to look like the above
program. (The main DML source file name should be the module name plus
the extension <tt>.dml</tt>. Although they are usually the same, the
module name does not have to be the same as the device name; a module
could potentially contain more than one device.)
<p>
Now, go to the <tt>[home]/workspace</tt> directory and run GNU
<tt>make</tt> (possibly named <tt>gmake</tt>, depending on your system).
By default, this builds all your modules.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  $ <b>cd <i>[home]</i>/workspace</b>
  $ <b>./simics targets/vacuum/vacuum.simics</b>
</pre>
<p>
When Simics has started, you should be prompted with
"<tt>simics&gt;</tt>".  Congratulations, you now have a loadable
Simics module! You can exit Simics by typing the <b>quit</b>
command, or <b>q</b> for short.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>q</b>
</pre>
