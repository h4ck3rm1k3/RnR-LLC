<h3 class="jdocu">1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example Device Models</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
Two example device models are included in the DML Toolkit package: an
AM79C960 Ethernet card and a DS12887 real-time clock. The source code
for the device models can be found in the directories
<tt>[simics]/src/devices/AM79C960-dml</tt> and
<tt>[simics]/src/devices/DS12887-dml</tt>, respectively.
<p>
There are also two Simics start scripts that can be used to run the
example devices in a simulated x86 machine. The start scripts are named
<tt>enterprise-AM79C960-dml.simics</tt> and
<tt>enterprise-DS12887-dml.simics</tt>, and can be found in the
<tt>[simics]/targets/x86-440bx</tt> directory.
<p>
Note that to be able to test run the example devices using the supplied
scripts, your Simics installation must include the simulated x86 machine
<tt>enterprise</tt> (the directory <tt>[simics]/targets/x86-440bx</tt>
must contain other files than the two mentioned above).
<p>
For further details about the example models, see the <em>Simics
Programming Guide</em>.
