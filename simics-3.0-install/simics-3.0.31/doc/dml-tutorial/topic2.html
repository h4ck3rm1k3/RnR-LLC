<p>
The DML Toolkit requires that you already have a Simics installation;
cf. Section <a class="jdocu" href="topic1.html#label5">1.1</a>. In the rest of this document,
we will refer to the file system path of the root directory of your
Simics installation as <tt>[simics]</tt>, and to your "home" directory
as <tt>[home]</tt>.
<p>
How to set up a working Simics build environment is described detail in
the <em>Simics Programming Guide</em>.
<p>
Note that to develop Simics modules on the Windows platform, you need
to work in a Cygwin environment (<a class="jdocu" href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_top">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>),
with the default packages of the Cygwin "devel" category installed,
and the separately installed MinGW compiler suite
(<a class="jdocu" href="http://www.mingw.org/" target="_top">http://www.mingw.org/</a>); see the <em>Simics Installation
Guide for Windows</em> for more information. You also need to ensure
that Simics isn't installed in a directory whose name contains any
spaces, since this will confuse the build scripts.
<p>
The DML Toolkit package can be installed at the same time as the Simics
base installation, using the normal install script. See the <em>Simics
Installation Guide</em> for details.
