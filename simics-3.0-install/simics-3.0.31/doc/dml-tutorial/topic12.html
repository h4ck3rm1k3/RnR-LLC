<h2 class="jdocu">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Events and Time</h2 class="jdocu">


<p>
In a hardware simulation, it can often be useful to let something happen
only after a certain amount of (simulated) time. This can be done in
Simics by "posting an event", which means that a callback function is
placed in a queue, to be executed later on in the simulation. The amount
of simulated time before the event is triggered is usually specified in
a number of seconds (as a floating-point number), but other units are
possible; see the <em>DML Reference Manual</em> for more
information.
<p>
We can modify our example to post an event when the register is written
to, as follows:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    dml 1.0;
    device simple_device;
    import "io-memory.dml";

    data int32 delay;
    bank b {
        parameter function = 0;
        register r0 size 4 @0x0000 {
            method write(val) {
                $this = 0;
                $delay = val;
                inline $ev.post($delay, NULL);
                log "info": "Posted tick event"; 
            }
            event ev {
                method event(void *data) {
                    ++$r0;
                    log "info": "Tick: %d.", $r0;
                    inline $this.post($delay, NULL);
                }
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
We use the register itself as a counter, which is reset to zero upon a
write access; the written value is used as the delay in seconds. Once
the event happens, it re-posts itself after the same interval. Note the
use of a <tt>data</tt> field to store the delay internally; we could
also have chosen to put the counter in the data field instead, or in a
more realistic example we could have modeled the counter as an
additional register. Also, the <b><i>post</i></b> method must be called with
the <tt>inline</tt> keyword, because its argument can be of varying
types.
<p>
After recompiling and restarting Simics, just enter the command
<b>continue</b> (or <b>c</b> for short). This simply runs the
simulation of the hardware. You should see no messages, since there is
nothing exciting going on in the machine, except that the clock is
ticking away. Press <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> to pause the simulation and get back
to the prompt.
<p>
Now write a large value to the register:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>phys_mem.set 0x1000 10000</b>
</pre>
(ignore any error messages about "no associated queue") and enter
<b>c</b> again. You should see "Tick"-messages being written at
fairly short intervals. Press <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> and write a lower value to
the register:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>phys_mem.set 0x1000 1</b>
</pre>
then start the simulation again. The messages are now printed at high
speed (although not ten thousand times as fast). The lesson from this is
that simulated time is not strictly proportional to real time, and if a
machine has very little to do, even 10,000 seconds can be simulated in a
very short time.
<p>
For simple cases of posting a callback after a specific time, you don't
even need to go through the trouble of declaring an event object and its
<b><i>event</i></b> method, and then call <b><i>post</i></b>. The following DML
statement creates and posts an anonymous event which calls a method
after a given time <tt>t</tt> in seconds:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    after (t) call $my_callback;
</pre>
Note that just like calling <b><i>post</i></b>, the effect is that the
callback is placed on a queue, and the DML program continues immediately
with the next statement following <tt>after</tt>, i.e., events are
executed <em>asynchronously</em>.
