<p>
In addition to attributes, Simics configuration objects can have
<em>interfaces</em>, which are named groups of methods. In fact, an
attribute can be viewed as a very simple interface with two methods
(<b><i>get</i></b> and <b><i>set</i></b>).
<p>
A Simics configuration consists of a number of interacting configuration
objects; for example, the machine <tt>vacuum</tt> consists of a clock, a
memory space, and a RAM. (The clock acts as a pseudo-CPU and is needed
to drive the execution.) Each of these is represented as a separate
configuration object, and the interaction between the objects is done
through interfaces.
<p>
To take a concrete example: when a CPU wants to make a memory access,
it will call the <b><i>access</i></b> method that is part of the
<tt>memory_space</tt> interface implemented by the memory space object.
If the memory space then finds some object (e.g., our device) mapped at
the accessed address, it will call the <b><i>operation</i></b> method in the
<tt>io_memory</tt> interface implemented by the mapped object. (If the
mapped object was our DML device, and we had included the standard
library file <tt>io-memory.dml</tt>, the device will automatically
contain an implementation of the <tt>io_memory</tt> interface, which
uses the function number of the mapping to pass on the operation to the
<b><i>access</i></b> method of the correct register bank in the DML program.)
<p>
A very basic question in this context is "how does one object find
another object?" Usually, objects are connected through attributes;
e.g., a CPU object could have an attribute that holds a reference to a
memory space object, and the memory space object has an attribute that
contains mapping information (which includes references to the mapped
objects), and so on. Such bindings are typically set up in the
configuration scripts for a simulated machine, and are not changed after
the initialization is done.
<p>
DML has built-in support both for letting your device implement any
number of interfaces, and for connecting other objects to your device
that implement particular interfaces.
