<h3 class="jdocu">2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loading And Testing</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
To test your new module, start Simics and load the example machine
configuration <tt>vacuum</tt>, as follows (from the
<tt>[home]/workspace</tt> directory):
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  $ <b>./simics targets/vacuum/vacuum.simics</b>
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>vacuum</tt> machine is a minimal configuarion that contains
only a clock and a memory space, called <b>phys_mem</b>, with some
RAM mapped at addresses <tt>0x10000000</tt> to <tt>0x1fffffff</tt>.
<p>
At the Simics prompt, type the <b>list-modules</b> command to see
if your module appears on the list:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>list-modules</b>
</pre>
<p>
Som of the modules in the list will have <tt>Loaded</tt> printed in
the second columnt, but not your new module.  You can load it using
the <b>load-module</b> command:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>load-module simple_device</b>
</pre>
<p>
If the module was successfully loaded, it should now be marked as
loaded in the output from by the <b>list-modules</b> command.
<p>
You can also try the <b>list-classes</b> command to see if your
device apears in the list of available models.  It should appear in
this list even if you have not loaded the module yet. Normally,
modules are loaded automatically when you try to use them, so the
<b>load-module</b> command is mostly used for testing.
<p>
To test the new model, we first of all need to create an instance of
the device class. This can be done with the following command:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>@SIM_create_object("simple_device", "dev1", [])</b>
</pre>
(the <b>@</b> operator on the Simics command line executes the rest of
the line as a Python expression), which uses the Simics API directly to
create a new object named <b>dev1</b>.
<p>
To be able to communicate with the device object, it must be mapped
into the physical memory space of the machine.  This can be done using
the <b>&lt;memory-space&gt;.add-map</b> command.
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>phys_mem.add-map dev1 0x1000 0x100 0</b>
</pre>
<p>
The first argument is the device to map, in this case our newly
created object <b>dev1</b>. The following arguments are the base
address within the memory space and the size of the mapped range.  The
fourth argument is the <em>function number</em> which is used by the
device model to choose which register bank will handle the accesses to
this mapping.  In this example, we have a mapping from the range
<tt>0x1000</tt>-<tt>0x10ff</tt> (0x100 bytes) to the range
<tt>0</tt>-<tt>0xff</tt> of function 0 (bank <tt>b</tt>) of the device
object <b>dev1</b>.
<p>
We can now try to read from register <tt>r0</tt> of our device. (Since
it has internal offset 0, it will correspond to address 0x1000 of the
physical memory.) Use the <b><i>get</i></b> method of the memory space to
simulate a read operation:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>phys_mem.get 0x1000</b>
</pre>
(do not use the <b>@</b> operator here). You should see the following
output:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  [dev1 info] Hello, bus!
  42
</pre>
The first line is the info message printed by the <tt>log</tt> statement
in the <b><i>read</i></b> method of <tt>r0</tt>, and the second is the value
that was returned by <b><i>get</i></b>. The device is working!
