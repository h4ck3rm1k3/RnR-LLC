<h3 class="jdocu">5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connecting Objects</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
As mentioned previously in this chapter, the usual way to make one
object accessible from another object, so that the latter (the caller)
may communicate with the former (the callee) via the interfaces it
implements, is to let the caller have an attribute that can hold an
object reference, and set that attribute to point to the callee object
(typically done in an initialization script). Although it is possible to
write an <tt>attribute</tt> definition by hand, suitable for connecting
an object with a particular interface, it is much better to use a
<tt>connect</tt> definition, which creates such an attribute with
minimal effort.
<p>
An interface, in Simics, is a struct containing function pointers, and
the definition of the struct must be visible both to the caller and the
callee. (The standard Simics API interface definitions are included
automatically by the DML compiler.) The convention in the Simics API is
to use a C <tt>typedef</tt> to name the struct type, using the suffix
<tt>_interface_t</tt>, and the DML compiler by default follows this
convention when it generates interface-related code. E.g., the
<tt>io_memory</tt> interface is described by a datatype
<tt>io_memory_interface_t</tt>, which is a struct containing two
function pointers <b><i>map</i></b> and <b><i>operation</i></b>. If the user wants
to create new interfaces, he must write his own struct definitions; this
is demonstrated below.
<p>
<a name="label22"></a><h4 class="jdocu">5.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connect Example</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
In the following example, we will create a second device and connect it
to the first device via a user-defined interface. We start with the
example device in section <a class="jdocu" href="topic6.html#label10">2.1</a>, and add the
following declaration:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    connect plugin {
        interface talk {
            parameter required = true;
        }
    }
</pre>
Then, we replace the line "<tt>log "info": ...;</tt>" with the following
C function call:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    $plugin.talk.hello($plugin);
</pre>
<p>
The members of an interface are C functions, not DML methods, so do
not use the <tt>call</tt> or <tt>inline</tt> keywords here. Also note
that <tt>$plugin</tt> itself is given as the first argument to the
function.  This is standard in most interfaces used in Simics.
<p>
Our device will now have an attribute named <i>plugin</i>, which can
hold object references; the attached objects are required to implement
the <tt>talk</tt> interface. However, we cannot yet compile the module,
since it is missing the definition of the interface.
<p>

<a name="label23"></a><h4 class="jdocu">5.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing Definitions</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
There are two main kinds of source files that may be shared by modules:
<ul>
  <li>DML files to be imported</li>
  <li>C header files to be included by the generated sources</li>
</ul>
<p>
We will put the definition of our simple <tt>talk</tt> interface in a
shared DML file. First of all, we need a place to put the file. Create a
new directory <tt>[home]/workspace/include</tt> (e.g., using
<tt>mkdir</tt> on a Unix system), and open the new file
<tt>[home]/workspace/include/talk.dml</tt> in your editor. Put the
following text in the file and save it:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    dml 1.0;

    struct talk_interface_t {
        void (*hello)(conf_object_t *obj);
    }
</pre>
(such a <tt>struct</tt> declaration in DML will both inform the DML
compiler about the existence of the struct type, as well as cause a
corresponding <tt>typedef</tt>-declaration in the generated C code).
<p>
Then, add this line to the example device code, to import the new file:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    import "talk.dml";
</pre>
<p>
Finally, edit the <tt>Makefile</tt> for the example device:
<tt>[home]/workspace/modules/simple_device/Makefile</tt>, and add the
following option to the definition of <tt>DMLC_FLAGS</tt>:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    -I$(SIMICS_WORKSPACE)/include
</pre>
(telling <tt>dmlc</tt> where to look for additional include files).
<p>
You should now be able to compile the example device with the
<tt>connect</tt> added as described above.
<p>
Sharing C header files (when necessary) is similar to the above: just
add a C compiler "<tt>-I...</tt>" flag to the makefile, and instead of
the DML <tt>import</tt> directive, use a C <tt>#include</tt> within a
<tt>header</tt> section, as in:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    header %{
      #include "stuff.h"
    %}
</pre>
    <p>


<a name="label24"></a><h4 class="jdocu">5.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Plug-in Module</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
To complete the example, we need an object that speaks the <tt>talk</tt>
interface, which we can use to connect to our device. For this purpose,
we add a new module to our workspace, as follows (cf. Section <a class="jdocu" href="topic6.html#label10">2.1</a>):
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  $ <b>[simics]/bin/workspace-setup --force --dml=plugin_module \
      [home]/workspace</b>
</pre>
(note that the <tt>--force</tt> flag is needed to add a module to an
existing workspace).
<p>
Edit the generated skeleton file
<tt>[home]/workspace/modules/plugin_module/plugin_module.dml</tt> to look
like this:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  dml 1.0;
  device plugin_module;

  import "talk.dml";

  implement talk {
      method hello {
          log "info": "Hi there!";
      }
  }
</pre>
The only way to use the objects of this class is through the
<tt>talk</tt> interface - there are no memory-mapped registers or
similar connections. (Do not take the term "device" too literally; a DML
source file does not have to model a piece of hardware - it just defines
a component class that can be loaded in Simics.)
<p>
Also edit the device makefile:
<tt>[home]/workspace/modules/plugin_module/Makefile</tt>, and add the
option <tt>-I$(SIMICS_WORKSPACE)/include</tt> to the definition of
<tt>DMLC_FLAGS</tt>, just like we did previously for the first example
device.
<p>

<a name="label25"></a><h4 class="jdocu">5.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing the Connect</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
Simply running <tt>make</tt> (or <tt>gmake</tt>) from the
<tt>[home]/workspace</tt> directory should now compile both modules. Do
this and restart Simics as before. (We assume that you have by now added
the commands from Section <a class="jdocu" href="topic7.html#label11">2.2</a> to the
startup script, as described in Section <a class="jdocu" href="topic8.html#label12">2.3</a>, so
that you do not have to enter them manually each time you run Simics.)
<p>
Enter the following command in the Simics console:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>@SIM_create_object("plugin_module", "dev2", [])</b>
</pre>
to create an instance of the plugin device. (Simics loads the module
automatically.)
<p>
Then, set the <i>plugin</i> attribute of the first example device to
point to the new object:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>dev1-&gt;plugin = dev2</b>
</pre>
<p>
We are now ready to run. Make a memory access to the first device:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>phys_mem.get 0x1000</b>
</pre>
and you should see the following output:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  [dev2 info] Hi there!
  42
</pre>
