<h3 class="jdocu">2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Configuration Attributes</h3 class="jdocu">


<p>
A Simics configuration consists of a machine description and a few
other parts, and it is divided into a number of <em>configuration
objects</em>.  Each device instance in the configuration is represented
by such an object. Any Simics configuration object has a number of
<em>attributes</em>. An attribute is a named property that can be read
or written using the Simics API.  The value of an attribute can be an
integer, a floating-point number, a string, an object reference, a
boolean value, a list of values, or a mapping from values to other
values.
<p>
Attributes are used for several related purposes, but the most
important uses are for <em>configuration</em> and
<em>checkpointing</em>.  All the internal state of a device object
must be available through the attributes, so that a checkpoint of the
current state can be saved by reading all the attributes and storing
the values to disk.  By reloading a configuration and setting all
attributes from the previously saved checkpoint, the states of all
devices can be restored to the checkpointed state and simulation can
continue as if it had never been interrupted.  When creating a new
configuration, some of the state must be given an explicit initial
assignment, which makes those attributes also part of the
configuration.  There may also be attributes that are not part of the
state, in the sense that they don't change during simulation. Instead,
they control the behavior of the model, such as buffer sizes, timing
parameters etc.  Those configuration attributes can generally not be
modified once the object has been created.
<p>
Attributes can also be used as a simple interface to an object, e.g.,
for inspecting or manipulating the state for debugging purposes.
<p>
A DML device model usually defines a number of attributes. By default,
each <tt>register</tt> defines a corresponding attribute that can be
used to get or set the register value, but more attributes can be
defined by explicitly declaring them in the DML source. In our example
above, for the register <tt>r0</tt> of bank <tt>b</tt> there will be a
device attribute named <i>b_r0</i> (note the underscore).
<p>
<a name="label15"></a><h4 class="jdocu">2.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Register Attributes</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
The <b><i>get</i></b> and <b><i>set</i></b> methods of a register are different
from its <b><i>read</i></b> and <b><i>write</i></b> methods in that they do not
simulate a hardware access (which often triggers side-effects in
devices). Instead, they offer a direct way of reading or modifying the
value of the register.
<p>
We can access the attribute from the Simics command line.
Continuing our example from the previous sections, enter:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>dev1-&gt;b_r0 = 17</b>
</pre>
and then enter
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>dev1-&gt;b_r0</b>
</pre>
which should print the value 17.
<p>
However, if we make a new memory access, as before:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>phys_mem.get 0x1000</b>
</pre>
we still get the message "Hello, bus!" and the value 42. But entering
<b>dev1-&gt;b_r0</b> once again still returns 17. What is going on?
<p>
The answer is of course that we had hard-coded the <b><i>read</i></b> method
to always return 42, no matter what. But this does not affect the
behavior of <b><i>get</i></b> and <b><i>set</i></b>, or the <b><i>write</i></b>
method. Let's try to make a write access:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>phys_mem.set 0x1000 0xff</b>
</pre>
Entering <b>conf-&gt;dev1.b_r0</b> now prints the value 255 as expected.
You can change the line
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    result = 42;
</pre>
in the program to:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    result = $this;
</pre>
(note the <tt>$</tt> character), recompile, and try the same accesses
again to check how a normal register would behave. Then change the code
back to return 42 for the rest of this section.
<p>
It is in fact often useful to create registers which either return a
constant (usually zero), or return a value that is computed on the fly.
For such registers, it is unnecessary to allocate memory for storing the
value inbetween calls. The allocation can be turned off by adding the
following line to the body of the register:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    parameter allocate = false;
</pre>
note, however, that doing so makes it necessary to implement your own
versions of the <b><i>get</i></b>, <b><i>set</i></b>, <b><i>read</i></b> and
<b><i>write</i></b> methods. (Try adding the above line to your code,
recompile, and run the example again. Note the messages you get when you
try to access the register in the various ways we have shown.)
<p>
A full implementation of such a "synthetic" constant register could
contain method definitions like the following:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    method write(value) {
        /* do nothing */
    }
    method get -&gt; (value) {
        value = 42;
    }
    method set(value) {
        if (value != 42)
            throw;
    }
</pre>
Try adding them (to the body of the register), recompile, and run the
example again.
<p>
The standard library file <tt>utility.dml</tt> contains several
pre-defined templates for common implementations such as this. To use
it, add the declaration "<tt>import "utility.dml";</tt>" to your source
file. The constant register can now simply be implemented as follows:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
      register r0 size 4 @0x0000 is (constant) {
          parameter value = 42;
      }
</pre>
or, if you still want to get a log message for each read access:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
      register r0 size 4 @0x0000 is (constant) {
          parameter value = 42;
          method read() -&gt; (result) {
              log "info", 1, 0: "Hello, bus!";
              result = $value;
          }
      }
</pre>
<p>

<a name="label16"></a><h4 class="jdocu">2.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User-defined Attributes</h4 class="jdocu">


<p>
It is sometimes useful to have device attributes that are not associated
with any register. If we just want the attribute to behave as a data
field, which stores a value of a simple data type such as <tt>int32</tt>
or <tt>bool</tt>, we only have to specify the parameter
<tt>allocate_type</tt>, as follows:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    attribute foo "an integer attribute" {
        parameter allocate_type = "int32";
    }
</pre>
(note that the data type must be specified as a string). Try adding this
code to your device (either before or after the <tt>bank</tt>),
recompile and rerun the example. Enter the following command:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>help attribute:dev1.foo</b>
</pre>
This prints some information about the attribute. Note that the
descriptive string you specified in the program is included in the
online documentation.
<p>
You can now experiment with setting and getting the value of the
attribute; e.g., entering
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
  simics&gt; <b>dev1-&gt;foo = 4711</b>
  simics&gt; <b>dev1-&gt;foo</b>
</pre>
should print 4711.
<p>
If it is important that other parts of the device are updated whenever
the value of the attribute is modified, the method <b><i>after_set</i></b>
can be overridden to perform such updates. (By default, it does
nothing.) For example:
<pre class="jdocu_small" style="color: black">
    method after_set {
        log "info": "Someone updated the attribute!";
    }
</pre>
Add this method to the body of the attribute, recompile and restart
Simics, then try setting and getting the value of the attribute.
<p>
If you want the attribute to do things differently, such as not store
the value between calls, or use a more complex data type, you need to do
more work on your own, instead of using the <tt>allocate_type</tt>
parameter; see the <em>DML Reference Manual</em> for details.
