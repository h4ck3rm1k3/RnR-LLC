        Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited
        non-commercial license to do the following:

        (iii) print one or more paper copies of the documentation for
        internal use if Licensee receives the documentation
        electronically; and

        (iv) develop "extensions" to the Software, where an
        "extension" refers to program modules developed by Licensee or
        other third party that connect to or otherwise interact with
        the Software using documented programming interfaces or
        communication protocols, and that are developed entirely by
        Licensee or other third party; Virtutech disclaims any right,
        title or interest in extensions developed in accordance with
        this Agreement; and,

        (v) create derivative works based on "components" of the
        Software if and only if the component in question has been
        provided in source code form by Virtutech, provided that
        Licensee uses such derivative works only in conjunction with
        and as a part of the Software or other licensed copies of the
        Software, where "component" refers to a part of the Software
        that implements features or functionality of the Software, and

        Virtutech.

    (b) Single User or "Seat" License.  Licensee may use the Software
    only on the authorized number of designated computers by the

    ENTITY THAT DEVELOPS MACHINE SIMULATORS THAT COMPETE WITH THE
    SOFTWARE TOOLS OFFERED BY VIRTUTECH;

3.  OWNERSHIP AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.  The Software, its structure,
    organization and code, and all documentation relating to the
    Software, are the confidential and proprietary property of
    Virtutech and/or its licensors, and all right, title and interest
    in and to such property and any and all copies of the Software (in
    whole or in part, and in any form) shall remain with Virtutech
    and/or its licensors, both during the term of and after any
    expiration or termination of this Agreement.  Licensee
    acknowledges that Virtutech and/or its licensors have patent,
    copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights in
    the Software under Swedish, United States and other foreign
    patent, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property
    laws and international treaty provisions, and that all such
    patent, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property
    rights remain the exclusive property of Virtutech and/or its
    licensors at all times.  Licensee shall not alter or remove any
    copyright or other proprietary notices on the Software or any
    other materials provided pursuant to this Agreement.  Licensee may
    use trademarks relating to the Software only to the extent
    required to comply with Section 1 of this Agreement ("Grant of
    License"), in accordance with accepted trademark practice,
    including identification of the trademark owner's name.  Such use
    of any trademark does not give Licensee any rights of ownership in
    that trademark.

4.  SUPPORT.  Virtutech will provide support for the Software by
    electronic means during Virtutech's normal business hours.
    Virtutech will provide Licensee with bug fixes, updates, and
    improvements to the Software at its sole discretion. Licensee may
    be entitled to additional technical support from Virtutech in
    accordance with separate written agreements, optionally attached
    to this Agreement. Evaluation, Virtutech Open Source Initiative
    and Academic Licensees of the Software are generally not entitled
    to any support, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

5.  OWNERSHIP AND SUFFICIENT RIGHTS.  Virtutech represents and
    warrants that it owns or has sufficient right, title, and interest
    in and to the Software to grant the licenses and other rights
    granted by Virtutech in this Agreement.

6.  INFRINGEMENT.  Virtutech agrees to defend and hold harmless
    Licensee, its officers and employees from and against any and all
    liabilities, losses, damages, fines, judgments, suits, actions or
    expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys'
    fees and costs) arising out of claims by a third party that the
    Software infringes a valid U.S. copyright, patent or trade secret
    or other U.S. proprietary right of that party.  If the Software is
    determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
    competent jurisdiction to infringe a valid U.S. copyright, patent
    or trade secret, then Virtutech shall, in its sole discretion,
    elect one or more of the following (and Licensee shall have no
    further recourse against Virtutech): (a) replace such Software,
    (b) modify such Software to make it non-infringing, or (c)
    terminate this Agreement, remove such Software and refund all fees
    paid to Virtutech by Licensee for same over the preceding 12 month
    period prior to such removal.  The remedy set forth in this
    Section 6 is conditioned upon Licensee: (a) providing Virtutech
    with written notice of any claim or cause of action within thirty
    (30) days of receiving notice or other knowledge of the claim or
    cause of action, (b) giving Virtutech sole control of the defense
    and all related settlement negotiations relating to such claim or
    action, (c) providing all reasonable assistance and cooperation as
    may be requested by Virtutech to enable Virtutech to defend the
    action or claim hereunder at Virtutech's sole expense or cost, and
    (d) refraining from compromising or settling such action or claim
    without the prior written consent of Virtutech.  Licensee may
    participate in its own defense at its own expense, provided that
    such participation does not violate Licensee's obligations under
    the preceding sentence.  Virtutech shall have no liability with
    respect to any infringement claim based upon the combination of
    the Software with other products not furnished by Virtutech, any
    addition to or modification of the Software by any person or
    entity other than Virtutech, or the use of a superseded or altered
    release of the Software.  THIS SECTION 6 SETS OUT VIRTUTECH'S
    ENTIRE LIABILITY AND LICENSEE'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR INFRINGEMENT.

7.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY
    PROVIDED IN SECTION 5 ABOVE, THE SOFTWARE AND ANY OTHER MATERIALS
    PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT ARE PROVIDED TO LICENSEE ON AN
    "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY NATURE.  VIRTUTECH
    SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE, EVEN IF VIRTUTECH HAS BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE, AS
    WELL AS ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR CUSTOM
    OF TRADE WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND ANY OTHER MATERIALS
    PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT.  VIRTUTECH DOES NOT WARRANT
    THAT THE SOFTWARE OR ANY ASSOCIATED MATERIALS PROVIDED BY
    VIRTUTECH WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION
    OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.  LICENSEE
    BEARS THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS
    THAT MAY BE OBTAINED BY USING THE SOFTWARE.

8.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT SHALL VIRTUTECH OR ITS
    LICENSORS OR RESELLERS BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER PERSON
    FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
    ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
    GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, PERSONAL
    INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, REVENUE,
    USE, DATA OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF
    OR RESULTING FROM LICENSEE'S POSSESSION OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE,
    EVEN IF VIRTUTECH HAS BEEN APPRISED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.  EXCEPT FOR VIRTUTECH'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 6
    ABOVE, IN NO EVENT WILL VIRTUTECH BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN
    EXCESS OF THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT VIRTUTECH RECEIVED FROM LICENSEE
    UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF VIRTUTECH SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED
    OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER
    PARTY.  THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE
    FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE
    AND INDEPENDENT OF ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THE LIMITED
    WARRANTY AND REMEDIES PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  The Software is provided with
    RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  Use, duplication or disclosure by the
    U.S. Government and parties acting on its behalf is subject to the
    restrictions set forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in
    Technical Data and Computer Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013
    or in subparagraphs (c)(1) and (2) of the Commercial Computer
    Software - Restricted Rights at 48 CFR 52.227-19, as applicable.

11. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  Licensee agrees not to export (including
    transferring electronically over any network, including the
    Internet) or re-export the Software, any part thereof, or any
    process or service that is the direct product of the Software, to
    any country, person, or entity -- even to foreign units of
    Licensee's own company -- in violation of U.S. and other
    applicable export laws, including without limitation the Export
    Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of
    Commerce and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
    administered by the U.S. Department of State.

12. PUBLICITY.  If the Software is a significant component in the
    development of open source software or in developing research
    results that are then published, then the Licensee agrees to
    clearly acknowledge the use of the Software in such a publication,
    including adequate information to uniquely identify Virtutech and
    the Software.

13. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

    (a) Definition.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential
    Information" means: (i) business and technical information and any
    source code, binary code, and documentation which Virtutech
    discloses to Licensee related to Software; (ii) Licensee's
    feedback based on Software; and (iii) the terms and conditions of
    this Agreement. Licensee may not disclose or use Confidential
    Information except as necessary in the performance of this
    Agreement or as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement or
    by Virtutech. Licensee will protect the Confidential Information

    furnished to Licensee by a third party without restriction on
    disclosure; or (iv) independently developed by Licensee without
    any use of the Confidential Information.

    (c) Access.  Licensee must restrict access to Confidential
    Information on a "need-to-know" basis to its employees or
    contractors with a need for this access to perform their
    employment or contractual obligations and who have agreed in
    writing to be bound by a confidentiality obligation which
    incorporates the protections and restrictions substantially as set
    forth in this Agreement.

14. GENERAL.

    (a) Entire Agreement; Amendment.  This Agreement sets forth the
    entire understanding and agreement between Virtutech and Licensee
    relating to Software and; (i) supersedes all prior or
    contemporaneous verbal or written communications, proposals, and
    representations with respect to its subject matter; (ii) prevails
    over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, purchase
    order, acknowledgement, or similar communication between the
    parties during the term of this Agreement; and, (iii) supersedes
    and replaces any "click through" license agreement, if any,
    contained in the Software. No modification to this Agreement will
    be binding, unless in writing and signed by a duly authorized
    representative of each party.

    (b) Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and
    construed under the laws of California if the Software is licensed
    for use in the United States of America, Canada, Mexico, or South
    America, the laws of Japan if the Software is licensed for use in
    Japan, and the laws of Sweden if the Software is licensed for use
    in Israel, Switzerland, Norway, the European Union or anywhere
    else worldwide not provided for in this section.  The application
    of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
    International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

    (c) Dispute Resolution.  In the event that this Agreement is
    governed by the laws of Sweden or Japan as provided under Section
    14(b) above, then all disputes, differences or questions between
    the parties with respect to any matter arising out of or relating
    to this Agreement shall be resolved by exclusive and binding
    arbitration in Stockholm, Sweden, under the Rules of Conciliation
    and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by three
    (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules.  The
    arbitration award shall be final and may be entered in any court
    having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for
    a judicial acceptance of the decision and an order of enforcement,
    as the case may be.  The official language in such arbitration
    proceeding shall be the English language.  In the event that this
    Agreement is governed by the laws of California as provided under
    Section 14(b) above, the parties agree that any action shall be
    subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. federal and
    State courts located in the State of California, and each of the
    parties hereto submits itself to the exclusive jurisdiction and
    venue of such courts for the purpose of such action.

    (d) Injunctive Relief.  The Parties agree that in the event of any
    controversy concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, the
    terms of this Agreement shall be enforceable in a court of equity
    by a decree of specific performance and that Virtutech shall be
    entitled to an injunction or other appropriate orders to restrain
    any such breach by Licensee without showing or proving any actual
    damage sustained by Virtutech.  Such a remedy shall, however, be
    cumulative and not exclusive, and shall be in addition to any
    other remedy which Virtutech may have.

    (e) Severability.  Whenever possible, each provision of this
    Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective
    and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this
    Agreement is determined by a court of applicable jurisdiction to
    be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such
    provision shall be modified or deleted in such a manner so as to
    make the Agreement as modified valid, legal and enforceable, and
    the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

    (f) Attorneys' Fees.  If any action or proceeding shall be
    commenced to enforce or interpret this Agreement or any right
    arising in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in
    such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the
    other party, all reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses
    incurred by such prevailing party in connection with such action
    or proceeding and any negotiations to avoid such action or
    proceeding.

    (g) Notices.  With the exception of email communication from
    Virtutech to Licensee, every notice or other communication
    required or contemplated by this Agreement shall be in writing and
    shall be deemed received and effective (i) on the date of personal
    delivery, (ii) on the date it is officially recorded as delivered
    to the intended recipient when sent by postage prepaid, return
    receipt requested, registered or certified mail (airmail if
    available), or the equivalent of registered or certified mail
    under the laws of the country where mailed, or in the absence of
    such record of delivery, the effective date shall be presumed to
    have been the fifth (5th) business day after it was deposited in
    the mail, (iii) on the date it is officially recorded as delivered
    to the intended recipient when sent by internationally recognized
    overnight courier, such as Federal Express, DHL or UPS, or in the
    absence of such record of delivery, the effective date shall be
    presumed to have been the third (3) business day after delivery to
    such courier, or (iv) the date transmitted by facsimile with a
    confirmation copy sent simultaneously by one of the other methods
    permitted under this Section 14(g), in each case addressed to the
    addresses identified in the introduction to this Agreement.
    Notice not given in writing shall be effective only if
    acknowledged in writing by a duly authorized representative of the
    party to whom it was given.  The exception to the above is that
    Virtutech may deliver notices or other communications to Licensee
    by email, for which the effective date will be the day immediately
    after transmission.  In the event Licensee otherwise needs to
    contact Virtutech, it may contact Virtutech at either of the
    following locations:
